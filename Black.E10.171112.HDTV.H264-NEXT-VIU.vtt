1
00:00:17.768 --> 00:00:20.909
Gosh. Where did it go?

2
00:00:27.549 --> 00:00:28.549
I found it!

3
00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.118
My gosh.

4
00:00:34.658 --> 00:00:38.358
Yes, this may bring back some memories.

5
00:00:42.099 --> 00:00:43.428
Gosh, hey!

6
00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:45.529
What on earth happened?

7
00:00:46.599 --> 00:00:48.599
I looked everywhere for you all day long.

8
00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:49.599
Who is this boy?

9
00:00:52.608 --> 00:00:54.978
- He's your brother. - Brother?

10
00:00:55.678 --> 00:00:56.779
Where is he now?

11
00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.779
I'm asking you where he is.

12
00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:00.949
He died.

13
00:01:02.118 --> 00:01:03.118
He died?

14
00:01:03.419 --> 00:01:04.419
Yes.

15
00:01:05.919 --> 00:01:08.259
A few days after taking this picture.

16
00:01:15.128 --> 00:01:18.669
Is this your son's? Please check what's inside.

17
00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:34.419
Moo...

18
00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:36.249
It looks like it was a hit-and-run accident.

19
00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:38.488
Moo... Moo Chan!

20
00:01:38.488 --> 00:01:41.218
In the end, the hit-and-run driver...

21
00:01:42.188 --> 00:01:43.789
was never caught.

22
00:01:44.458 --> 00:01:46.929
It seems like it was only yesterday when Moo Chan died,

23
00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:48.929
but two decades have passed already.

24
00:01:49.298 --> 00:01:50.529
Moo Chan?

25
00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:52.999
Wasn't his name Kim Joon?

26
00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:55.268
That's right. His name was Kim Joon.

27
00:01:55.268 --> 00:01:56.869
He changed his name when he came to live with us.

28
00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.539
He wanted to have his dad's surname,

29
00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:01.779
so we named him as Han Moo Chan.

30
00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:04.479
He wanted...

31
00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.848
to erase the memories from the time that he lived with his birth mom.

32
00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.519
Your dad had him with a woman he met...

33
00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.288
when he was teaching at a university in Moojin...

34
00:02:16.288 --> 00:02:18.359
for a short amount of time before he met me.

35
00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:20.728
His birth mom asked us to look after him for a little while,

36
00:02:20.728 --> 00:02:23.198
saying that something came up.

37
00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:27.239
We said we'd take care of him because we felt bad for her,

38
00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.038
and you were also very happy...

39
00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:31.968
about getting a big brother.

40
00:02:31.968 --> 00:02:33.438
The two of you...

41
00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:36.309
cared so much about each other.

42
00:02:36.508 --> 00:02:37.649
Moo Chan...

43
00:02:39.378 --> 00:02:41.779
also adored you a lot and was always there for you.

44
00:02:42.448 --> 00:02:44.489
Even though he was only a year older than you,

45
00:02:44.848 --> 00:02:48.258
he really was like a big brother to you.

46
00:02:50.758 --> 00:02:54.098
So that girl's first love died a long time ago.

47
00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:59.369
Then what's this?

48
00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.839
Moo Chan used to wear it all the time.

49
00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:06.568
He was wearing it when he got into the accident as well.

50
00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.809
You've always been wearing it and said it's a keepsake from him.

51
00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.948
They sure are brothers. They look very much like each other.

52
00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.549
Anyway, if that girl finds out that her first love is actually dead...

53
00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.418
Joon. Joon.

54
00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:23.788
Joon?

55
00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:26.228
What... What's going on? Why are you here at this hour?

56
00:03:26.228 --> 00:03:27.829
It's cold outside. Why are you sitting out here?

57
00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:29.459
You even left your gate doors open.

58
00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:31.598
This is yours.

59
00:03:31.598 --> 00:03:32.598
What is this?

60
00:03:32.598 --> 00:03:35.239
You gave it to me when you were moving to Seoul.

61
00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:36.869
You asked me to hold onto it and treasure it.

62
00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:38.938
All the girls at school fell head over heels for you...

63
00:03:38.938 --> 00:03:41.109
when you sang while playing this guitar.

64
00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:43.309
Play it now, Joon.

65
00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:44.309
Me?

66
00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.679
I don't know how to play this. No. I mean, I forgot it all.

67
00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:48.978
I lost my memory, you know.

68
00:03:48.978 --> 00:03:51.089
I read somewhere that your body remembers everything...

69
00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:52.989
even if you lost your memory.

70
00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.788
Don't be like that, and just try it.

71
00:03:54.788 --> 00:03:57.329
Come on. Do it.

72
00:04:00.929 --> 00:04:03.968
My memory... I don't really remember how to do it.

73
00:04:04.728 --> 00:04:06.869
What's going on here? I can't get this open.

74
00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:07.869
I can't open it.

75
00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:10.468
- It doesn't open? - No, just take it back.

76
00:04:10.468 --> 00:04:12.769
Right, it's never been opened for 20 years.

77
00:04:14.008 --> 00:04:16.309
Oh, you have tools at home, right?

78
00:04:16.309 --> 00:04:17.409
What?

79
00:04:18.778 --> 00:04:20.979
Hey, wait. Hey.

80
00:04:22.578 --> 00:04:23.688
What on earth is this?

81
00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:27.088
I obviously don't know how to play this human instrument.

82
00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:28.559
Do I?

83
00:04:29.318 --> 00:04:30.588
What is this thing?

84
00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:34.729
Give it to me. I'm really good at fixing things like this.

85
00:04:34.929 --> 00:04:36.659
But you don't have to...

86
00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:39.499
Give it to me. Come on, give it to me.

87
00:04:40.338 --> 00:04:41.469
- What? - What is it?

88
00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:44.138
- That's strange. - What?

89
00:04:44.239 --> 00:04:47.208
When you said you wanted to be a police officer after meeting my dad,

90
00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:49.309
those delinquents...

91
00:04:49.338 --> 00:04:51.148
I'm going to become a police officer.

92
00:04:52.179 --> 00:04:54.249
So I don't want to hang out with you.

93
00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:56.919
A police officer? We were going to recruit you since you fight well.

94
00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:58.849
But what? You little brat!

95
00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:01.818
How dare you scowl at me like that?

96
00:05:02.888 --> 00:05:04.628
Do you want me to poke your eyes out?

97
00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:08.099
Hey! Do you want me to pound your heads in a mortar?

98
00:05:10.628 --> 00:05:12.869
Get off me, you brat!

99
00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:21.938
It left a deep scar, but it's gone.

100
00:05:22.578 --> 00:05:23.648
Hey, that's enough.

101
00:05:23.878 --> 00:05:25.708
What time is it? What are you doing? Get home now.

102
00:05:25.708 --> 00:05:26.948
I'm exhausted. Get home quickly.

103
00:05:26.948 --> 00:05:28.349
What? What is this?

104
00:05:30.619 --> 00:05:33.119
- What is it? - It's... It's nothing.

105
00:05:34.088 --> 00:05:35.958
What? Is that a picture of a naked woman?

106
00:05:36.188 --> 00:05:37.188
No... No, it isn't.

107
00:05:37.628 --> 00:05:39.388
I bet it is.

108
00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:41.559
Why are you hiding it then? Let me see.

109
00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:43.128
Let me see it.

110
00:05:43.128 --> 00:05:44.999
Give it to me. Give it to me.

111
00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:46.099
Give... Give it to me.

112
00:05:49.198 --> 00:05:51.338
Joon, your first love, is dead.

113
00:05:53.739 --> 00:05:55.809
Yes. It's better for you not to know.

114
00:05:58.508 --> 00:05:59.508
I...

115
00:05:59.508 --> 00:06:01.578
- Just go home now. Go. - Okay.

116
00:06:01.578 --> 00:06:02.818
- Just let me get my bag. - I'm exhausted.

117
00:06:03.018 --> 00:06:05.049
- Gosh. - It's so late at night. Go home.

118
00:06:05.049 --> 00:06:07.188
Fine. I'm going.

119
00:06:07.588 --> 00:06:08.958
This is too much. Seriously.

120
00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:13.898
What? Why is this here?

121
00:06:16.359 --> 00:06:17.898
Isn't this that stone?

122
00:06:21.869 --> 00:06:23.499
Seriously.

123
00:06:23.638 --> 00:06:26.008
Gosh. This is why I painted it white.

124
00:06:31.008 --> 00:06:32.708
Joon.

125
00:06:45.688 --> 00:06:48.299
This isn't Joon. Of course there is no scar.

126
00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:54.568
What is that anyway?

127
00:06:57.809 --> 00:07:01.309
Gosh, I'm sure she will keep asking me to play it. Won't she?

128
00:07:01.638 --> 00:07:03.179
Where did she find it?

129
00:07:07.378 --> 00:07:09.878
Hey. Have they issued an arrest warrant for Oh Sang Min yet?

130
00:07:09.878 --> 00:07:11.088
Not yet.

131
00:07:12.448 --> 00:07:13.448
Hello?

132
00:07:14.489 --> 00:07:15.489
What?

133
00:07:17.128 --> 00:07:18.128
Okay.

134
00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:25.068
Gwang Gyun, they rejected to issue a warrant.

135
00:07:27.338 --> 00:07:28.338
What?

136
00:07:30.809 --> 00:07:32.768
That darn prosecutor.

137
00:07:36.578 --> 00:07:37.708
He's coming out!

138
00:07:37.708 --> 00:07:40.208
- He's coming out! - Please tell us what happened.

139
00:07:40.208 --> 00:07:42.549
- Why did you hide the truth? - Why did you assault her?

140
00:07:42.549 --> 00:07:44.549
- Stop right there! - Please give us a comment.

141
00:07:44.948 --> 00:07:46.619
How do you feel right now?

142
00:07:47.989 --> 00:07:50.859
You did well. Stand tall and proud.

143
00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:53.628
How do you feel right now?

144
00:07:53.729 --> 00:07:54.729
Please give us a comment.

145
00:07:55.359 --> 00:07:56.559
How do you feel right now?

146
00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:57.969
Hello, Senator Nam.

147
00:07:58.869 --> 00:08:00.599
Thank you for your concerns.

148
00:08:01.138 --> 00:08:03.198
You know I always return favors, right?

149
00:08:03.198 --> 00:08:05.039
The prosecution rejected to issue a warrant.

150
00:08:05.638 --> 00:08:08.609
According to the authorities, the reason of the rejection...

151
00:08:08.878 --> 00:08:13.208
is because it's his first offense, and he admitted his wrongdoings...

152
00:08:13.208 --> 00:08:14.979
and regretted it deeply.

153
00:08:15.378 --> 00:08:16.778
Moreover, they've decided that...

154
00:08:16.778 --> 00:08:19.719
it's unlikely that he will try to destroy the evidence or run away.

155
00:08:20.088 --> 00:08:23.159
He's regretting it, and he won't run away?

156
00:08:23.159 --> 00:08:25.028
As they rejected to issue an arrest warrant...

157
00:08:36.939 --> 00:08:39.308
Uncle Man Soo. What happened to your neck?

158
00:08:39.308 --> 00:08:41.479
Do you wear Sip Gyeon's leash or something?

159
00:08:42.178 --> 00:08:43.508
Is it some kind of fashion?

160
00:08:49.449 --> 00:08:51.989
I must find proof that Man Ho tried to kill me no matter what.

161
00:08:54.888 --> 00:08:55.888
That's right.

162
00:08:56.989 --> 00:08:58.388
There was a witness.

163
00:09:11.408 --> 00:09:12.538
You didn't see it?

164
00:09:12.538 --> 00:09:14.739
You ran towards the door to catch the killer.

165
00:09:14.739 --> 00:09:16.138
- Did I? - Yes.

166
00:09:16.138 --> 00:09:19.408
I was just going to check if someone had come in,

167
00:09:19.479 --> 00:09:21.819
but I couldn't because you hung on to me.

168
00:09:22.079 --> 00:09:23.219
Persistently.

169
00:09:24.648 --> 00:09:27.288
You really didn't see anything?

170
00:09:27.589 --> 00:09:29.918
No. I'm busy.

171
00:09:30.018 --> 00:09:31.028
Wait.

172
00:09:32.689 --> 00:09:34.099
"My boss"?

173
00:09:34.729 --> 00:09:35.729
What?

174
00:09:40.298 --> 00:09:41.569
Detective Han. Wait...

175
00:09:43.138 --> 00:09:44.138
That's strange.

176
00:09:44.969 --> 00:09:46.109
I'm sure...

177
00:09:46.538 --> 00:09:49.008
that I saw him grabbing the killer's hair.

178
00:09:49.979 --> 00:09:51.178
Was I mistaken?

179
00:09:51.808 --> 00:09:53.579
Do you all wish to die?

180
00:09:53.579 --> 00:09:55.418
Crazy Dog. I know you're crazy,

181
00:09:55.418 --> 00:09:59.918
but how could you attack a prosecutor?

182
00:09:59.918 --> 00:10:01.719
- You should all know better. - Yes. We're sorry, sir.

183
00:10:04.329 --> 00:10:05.489
You should all know better.

184
00:10:05.489 --> 00:10:07.229
What's going on?

185
00:10:08.829 --> 00:10:09.829
Here.

186
00:10:10.158 --> 00:10:11.869
Teach me how to use social media.

187
00:10:12.128 --> 00:10:15.398
Hey. Can't you see what's going on here?

188
00:10:15.599 --> 00:10:17.739
- What? - Gwang Gyun is in trouble.

189
00:10:18.308 --> 00:10:20.939
He bit the prosecutor on Oh Sang Min's case.

190
00:10:22.808 --> 00:10:24.079
He's Crazy Dog indeed.

191
00:10:24.548 --> 00:10:26.849
Anyway, teach me how to use social media.

192
00:10:28.378 --> 00:10:29.749
Are you serious?

193
00:10:29.749 --> 00:10:32.288
Gwang Gyun is going through all that trouble because of you.

194
00:10:37.959 --> 00:10:38.959
Hurry up now.

195
00:10:39.359 --> 00:10:41.229
- Seriously? - Hey, just give it to me.

196
00:10:41.359 --> 00:10:42.758
I'll teach you, you brat.

197
00:10:44.999 --> 00:10:46.499
Gosh, that brat.

198
00:10:46.499 --> 00:10:47.739
What do I do from here?

199
00:10:49.439 --> 00:10:51.168
Gosh. I have no witness...

200
00:10:51.369 --> 00:10:52.768
or evidence.

201
00:10:53.569 --> 00:10:56.308
I can't see Byung Ho either. This is driving me crazy.

202
00:10:58.548 --> 00:10:59.648
Sip Gyeon.

203
00:11:01.079 --> 00:11:02.249
Sip Gyeon?

204
00:11:04.249 --> 00:11:05.388
Sip Gyeon.

205
00:11:08.388 --> 00:11:09.459
Who are you?

206
00:11:09.788 --> 00:11:12.388
Let go of me. Who are you? Get off me!

207
00:11:12.528 --> 00:11:14.359
What are you doing? Get off me!

208
00:11:15.959 --> 00:11:17.699
Darn it. Let go of me!

209
00:11:19.128 --> 00:11:21.898
What are you doing? Are you going to kill me out in the open now?

210
00:11:21.898 --> 00:11:23.908
I know you resent me and all,

211
00:11:24.739 --> 00:11:26.469
but how could you accuse me...

212
00:11:27.408 --> 00:11:28.939
as a scum who kills his own brother?

213
00:11:28.939 --> 00:11:31.378
Are you still playing innocent with me, you jerk?

214
00:11:32.908 --> 00:11:34.979
- Get off me! - This is driving me crazy.

215
00:11:38.449 --> 00:11:40.788
I heard you went around looking for witnesses all day.

216
00:11:41.158 --> 00:11:43.158
So did you find one?

217
00:11:43.219 --> 00:11:46.089
Did you find anyone who saw me trying to kill you?

218
00:11:47.599 --> 00:11:49.459
I guess you didn't. Too bad.

219
00:11:50.798 --> 00:11:52.369
Bring it in.

220
00:11:55.768 --> 00:11:58.138
- Sip Gyeon... Sip Gyeon! - Hey, Mr. Witness.

221
00:11:58.138 --> 00:11:59.508
Let go of me, you jerk!

222
00:11:59.508 --> 00:12:02.579
- Hey, Oh Man Ho! - Did I try to kill Man Soo?

223
00:12:02.579 --> 00:12:05.249
Say something. This is so unfair.

224
00:12:05.249 --> 00:12:08.418
- I will kill you if you touch him. - He's not saying anything.

225
00:12:08.449 --> 00:12:11.089
- Let go of me! - Sip Gyeon. Will you not tell me?

226
00:12:11.619 --> 00:12:13.859
I asked you if I tried to kill Man Soo!

227
00:12:14.388 --> 00:12:15.388
Man Ho.

228
00:12:16.359 --> 00:12:17.359
Please don't.

229
00:12:19.888 --> 00:12:20.928
I'm sorry.

230
00:12:20.928 --> 00:12:22.558
Now, you know whom you're talking to.

231
00:12:22.829 --> 00:12:25.069
You called me a jerk earlier.

232
00:12:26.229 --> 00:12:28.739
I'm sorry. You should hit me instead.

233
00:12:28.739 --> 00:12:30.308
- I know, right? - Yes.

234
00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:34.278
- Get the dog out. - You old lag!

235
00:12:39.249 --> 00:12:41.778
If you didn't want to take the blame for Sang Min,

236
00:12:41.778 --> 00:12:43.849
you should've at least stayed quiet.

237
00:12:44.219 --> 00:12:46.788
How dare you threaten me, you old lag?

238
00:12:47.158 --> 00:12:50.018
You petty jerk! You old lag.

239
00:12:52.058 --> 00:12:53.729
This darn dog!

240
00:12:54.128 --> 00:12:56.359
Get off me! You stupid dog.

241
00:12:58.268 --> 00:12:59.969
This darn dog.

242
00:13:00.499 --> 00:13:04.209
- No... No! No! - Darn it.

243
00:13:06.638 --> 00:13:08.609
How dare you bite people?

244
00:13:10.349 --> 00:13:13.479
If you don't want the same thing to happen to you,

245
00:13:13.949 --> 00:13:15.048
sign this.

246
00:13:15.349 --> 00:13:16.418
Hey, Oh Man Soo!

247
00:13:17.249 --> 00:13:19.288
Sign it now. Let me help you.

248
00:13:19.449 --> 00:13:20.619
Come here.

249
00:13:22.758 --> 00:13:25.628
How nice is it when you're being such a good boy?

250
00:13:32.699 --> 00:13:34.469
I just realized once again...

251
00:13:35.638 --> 00:13:37.908
that this is such a nice country to live in.

252
00:13:41.239 --> 00:13:43.308
They are generous to minors...

253
00:13:44.048 --> 00:13:45.609
and conglomerates.

254
00:13:46.449 --> 00:13:49.778
And they couldn't issue the warrant when my dad pulled some strings.

255
00:13:50.819 --> 00:13:52.119
Do they think I'm an idiot?

256
00:13:52.788 --> 00:13:56.058
How could I mistake marijuana for tobacco?

257
00:13:57.989 --> 00:13:59.189
Hey.

258
00:13:59.829 --> 00:14:01.558
Yes, I saved one for you.

259
00:14:30.989 --> 00:14:32.628
- What is that? - It's him, right?

260
00:14:32.628 --> 00:14:34.258
- Isn't that marijuana? - The prosecution...

261
00:14:34.258 --> 00:14:35.758
had denied the request for a warrant by lack of evidence...

262
00:14:35.758 --> 00:14:37.528
- against Oh Sang Min, - What's happening?

263
00:14:37.528 --> 00:14:40.499
but he was found at the airport departure gate this morning.

264
00:14:40.499 --> 00:14:44.008
He planned to leave the country while he was being investigated...

265
00:14:44.008 --> 00:14:46.339
as the prosecution declined the request for his arrest warrant...

266
00:14:46.339 --> 00:14:47.839
and insisted that he wouldn't flee.

267
00:14:47.839 --> 00:14:51.249
So many people are questioning if there was any external pressure.

268
00:14:51.278 --> 00:14:53.109
Also, more marijuana...

269
00:14:53.109 --> 00:14:55.148
was found in his suitcase,

270
00:14:55.148 --> 00:14:57.418
which means that his statement about how he confused...

271
00:14:57.418 --> 00:15:00.689
marijuana with tobacco is also false.

272
00:15:00.719 --> 00:15:02.989
In addition, the phone conversation between him and his friend...

273
00:15:02.989 --> 00:15:05.589
has gone viral on social media,

274
00:15:05.589 --> 00:15:06.859
disproving...

275
00:15:06.859 --> 00:15:09.058
the prosecution's statement about regretting his conduct.

276
00:15:09.298 --> 00:15:10.928
Many are questioning whether it's because...

277
00:15:10.928 --> 00:15:12.569
- he's a corporate heir... - What kind of jerk did this?

278
00:15:12.569 --> 00:15:13.739
Whose ruse is this?

279
00:15:13.739 --> 00:15:16.439
- The prosecution denied everything, - There he comes.

280
00:15:16.439 --> 00:15:19.638
- How do you feel now? - but it has accepted...

281
00:15:19.638 --> 00:15:21.439
- Where did you get the marijuana? - the police's request,

282
00:15:21.439 --> 00:15:24.048
and the court has issued an arrest warrant against him.

283
00:15:26.609 --> 00:15:28.648
The police have launched an investigation...

284
00:15:28.648 --> 00:15:31.219
to find the person who first disseminated the video clip,

285
00:15:31.219 --> 00:15:33.119
which was the main reason for the arrest warrant to be issued.

286
00:15:33.119 --> 00:15:34.489
Meanwhile, some netizens...

287
00:15:34.489 --> 00:15:36.388
are speculating that it could be...

288
00:15:36.388 --> 00:15:38.229
the same person who disseminated...

289
00:15:38.229 --> 00:15:40.729
the photos which proved Woo Byung Sik was alive.

290
00:15:40.729 --> 00:15:41.959
How much do you want?

291
00:15:43.359 --> 00:15:44.699
You punk.

292
00:15:48.199 --> 00:15:49.199
Let's go.

293
00:15:52.239 --> 00:15:54.538
Sip... Sip Gyeon.

294
00:16:02.249 --> 00:16:04.219
I just realized once again...

295
00:16:06.089 --> 00:16:08.359
that this is such a nice country to live in.

They are generous to minors...

297
00:16:12.888 --> 00:16:14.898
and conglomerates.

298
00:16:18.229 --> 00:16:19.469
Marijuana...

299
00:16:21.138 --> 00:16:23.138
Where could he have hidden it?

300
00:16:33.209 --> 00:16:34.678
What a punk.

301
00:16:34.678 --> 00:16:38.288
By the way, who did such a wonderful deed?

302
00:16:38.689 --> 00:16:40.359
Did Mr. Oh do it?

303

Mom, I want to live with you. Mom!

308
00:17:11.588 --> 00:17:13.588
I'm scared to live at Dad's house.

309
00:17:13.989 --> 00:17:15.489
My brother scares me too.

310
00:17:15.919 --> 00:17:17.788
Even his mom scares me.

311
00:17:23.528 --> 00:17:24.729
Mom.

312
00:17:24.729 --> 00:17:25.929
You see this, right?

313
00:17:25.929 --> 00:17:28.639
I'm no longer your mom.

314
00:17:33.068 --> 00:17:34.338
Mom...

315
00:17:36.639 --> 00:17:37.649
Mom...

316
00:17:44.818 --> 00:17:46.189
You even put your life on the line...

317

just to send your son to a rich family.

318

Both you and I...

319
00:17:55.229 --> 00:17:56.558
are in an utter mess now.

320
00:18:10.108 --> 00:18:13.649
(My son did not suffer from depression.)

321
00:18:24.358 --> 00:18:27.399
Hello, Doctor. This is Kyung Soo's mom.

322
00:18:28.429 --> 00:18:30.028
There's something I must tell you.

323
00:18:30.929 --> 00:18:33.999
I'll stop by your office.

We're just waiting on the final approval,

329

but I heard that some of the board members...

are saying that we should reconsider the decision to sell it.

00:19:34.858 --> 00:19:38.229
The numbers have gone up since he took the position,

333
00:19:38.229 --> 00:19:39.729
and we've rarely lost any clients.

334
00:19:39.729 --> 00:19:43.439
Gosh, those old jerks on the board...

335
00:19:44.268 --> 00:19:45.709
Go ahead, and sell it immediately.

336
00:19:45.709 --> 00:19:47.209
And get an article out to blame Man Soo for doing it.

337
00:19:47.209 --> 00:19:49.538
After a few days, we'll announce his resignation.

338
00:19:49.538 --> 00:19:52.249
How's the construction coming along for the shopping complex?

339
00:19:52.249 --> 00:19:55.348
That's... It's still put on pause.

340
00:19:55.818 --> 00:19:58.848
The civic groups and victim families are strongly against it.

341
00:19:59.219 --> 00:20:02.288
Also, Congressman Kim Young Seok is maintaining a firm stance on it.

342
00:20:02.288 --> 00:20:06.328
Goodness. Those idiots are driving me crazy.

343
00:20:06.489 --> 00:20:09.558
We must tackle it head on to sort out the situation now.

344
00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:12.828
I'll build the biggest shopping complex in Asia...

345
00:20:12.828 --> 00:20:14.538
to show the whole world that I still have the power.

346
00:20:14.969 --> 00:20:16.639
Resume the construction immediately.

347
00:20:16.639 --> 00:20:18.508
Yes, sir. I'll instruct them to do so.

348
00:20:22.308 --> 00:20:23.508
Who is this boy?

349
00:20:34.219 --> 00:20:35.389
(Joon's mom)

350
00:20:45.729 --> 00:20:47.068
This is Moo Gang's mom.

351
00:20:48.368 --> 00:20:50.038
I'd like to talk to you about something. Let's meet.

352
00:20:55.239 --> 00:20:56.639
Why did you want to see me?

353
00:20:56.639 --> 00:20:59.649
Moo Gang lost his memory due to an accident.

354
00:21:00.578 --> 00:21:02.048
He was in an accident?

355
00:21:02.249 --> 00:21:04.618
He was held hostage at a shopping mall a while ago...

356
00:21:04.919 --> 00:21:06.348
and nearly died.

357
00:21:06.348 --> 00:21:07.358
Then...

358
00:21:08.088 --> 00:21:09.959
the detective I saw on the news was...

359
00:21:10.389 --> 00:21:12.429
Yes, that's right.

360
00:21:12.828 --> 00:21:14.929
He managed to survive,

361
00:21:15.929 --> 00:21:18.729
but he doesn't remember anything that happened before the accident.

362
00:21:19.598 --> 00:21:20.868
He doesn't even recognize...

363
00:21:22.399 --> 00:21:23.709
his own mother, me.

364
00:21:25.169 --> 00:21:26.608
I had no idea.

365
00:21:26.608 --> 00:21:29.838
You know why Moo Gang became a detective, right?

366
00:21:30.879 --> 00:21:34.449
He quit his stable job in the US and joined the police force here...

367
00:21:34.449 --> 00:21:36.318
to work as a detective because of you.

368
00:21:36.719 --> 00:21:39.118
Because you said those useless things to him...

369
00:21:39.118 --> 00:21:40.518
I'm sorry.

370
00:21:43.459 --> 00:21:45.788
I don't want you to show up before him ever again.

371
00:21:46.858 --> 00:21:50.429
Even if Moo Gang visits you,

372
00:21:50.429 --> 00:21:52.298
please don't say anything to him.

373
00:21:54.239 --> 00:21:55.338
Okay.

374
00:21:57.709 --> 00:21:58.768
All right.

375
00:22:00.838 --> 00:22:02.838
Then I'll trust you...

376
00:22:04.278 --> 00:22:05.749
and get going now.

377
00:22:12.518 --> 00:22:14.159
(Site for the biggest shopping complex in Asia)

378
00:22:20.298 --> 00:22:21.629
My goodness.

379
00:22:22.959 --> 00:22:24.899
- What? - Wait, just a minute. Hold it!

380
00:22:25.169 --> 00:22:28.098
- What's that? - Gosh, iron bars are buried.

381
00:22:28.399 --> 00:22:29.538
Move it up.

382
00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:33.008
- Doctor. - A cup of Americano, please.

383
00:22:34.338 --> 00:22:35.338
Doctor.

384
00:22:35.778 --> 00:22:38.179
- Please hear me out. - Why is she supposed to die?

385
00:22:38.179 --> 00:22:39.308
Is she ill?

386
00:22:39.308 --> 00:22:40.449
Why do you want to know?

387
00:22:40.449 --> 00:22:42.879
We're not allowed to pity humans no matter what.

388
00:22:43.118 --> 00:22:44.449
Have you forgotten about that?

389
00:22:44.949 --> 00:22:47.258
Why am I always like this?

390
00:22:47.358 --> 00:22:49.489
I keep acting like a human.

391
00:22:50.088 --> 00:22:52.929
My dream is to become a ruthless...

392
00:22:52.929 --> 00:22:55.098
and heartless Grim Reaper like Black.

393
00:22:55.098 --> 00:22:57.098
Do you want to be like 444?

394
00:22:57.098 --> 00:22:59.669
Of course. He's so cool and unsentimental.

395
00:22:59.669 --> 00:23:02.268
He's intelligent too. I respect him a lot.

396
00:23:02.268 --> 00:23:03.368
I mean, I did.

397
00:23:03.368 --> 00:23:04.608
You did?

398
00:23:04.669 --> 00:23:06.909
He has completely changed ever since...

399
00:23:06.909 --> 00:23:08.179
he occupied Han Moo Gang's body.

400
00:23:12.278 --> 00:23:13.508
What do you mean you didn't see anything?

401
00:23:13.508 --> 00:23:16.078
Kyung Soo died so unfairly.

402
00:23:16.078 --> 00:23:17.489
- Just a moment, please. - What?

403
00:23:17.749 --> 00:23:20.419
I really can't say anything about...

404
00:23:26.588 --> 00:23:28.828
Where have you guys been these last few days?

405
00:23:28.828 --> 00:23:30.469
I looked everywhere for you two.

406
00:23:30.828 --> 00:23:31.899
You tried to find us?

407
00:23:33.568 --> 00:23:35.499
You used to always tell us to get lost.

408
00:23:35.499 --> 00:23:37.068
What has gotten into you?

409
00:23:37.068 --> 00:23:39.169
- We have a bit of a problem. - What?

410
00:23:39.169 --> 00:23:41.439
What's up? What happened?

411
00:23:43.778 --> 00:23:45.778
Apparently, Han Moo Gang is not Joon.

412
00:23:46.078 --> 00:23:47.548
- What? - In other words, this body...

413
00:23:47.548 --> 00:23:49.548
is not that girl's first love.

414
00:23:49.679 --> 00:23:52.088
Gosh, that's crazy. Really?

415
00:23:52.088 --> 00:23:54.659
Because I was wearing the bracelet she gave to Joon...

416
00:23:54.659 --> 00:23:57.929
I mean, Han Moo Gang was wearing it. That's why she was confused.

417
00:23:59.159 --> 00:24:01.999
Besides, Han Moo Gang and Joon resembled each other a lot as kids.

418
00:24:01.999 --> 00:24:03.499
They're half-brothers and share the same father.

419
00:24:03.499 --> 00:24:06.999
My gosh, like what I see in TV dramas all the time?

420
00:24:06.999 --> 00:24:08.798
Do you mean that kind of half-brothers?

421
00:24:08.798 --> 00:24:10.868
She won't even want to help me if she finds out...

422
00:24:10.868 --> 00:24:12.739
that Han Moo Gang is not Joon.

423
00:24:13.139 --> 00:24:15.508
She goes on about Joon all day long!

424
00:24:15.838 --> 00:24:17.949
Why are you getting so worked up over it?

425
00:24:19.479 --> 00:24:21.848
- What? - Is the fact that he's not Joon...

426
00:24:22.348 --> 00:24:24.889
that important to you?

427
00:24:24.889 --> 00:24:26.848
Isn't that obvious?

428
00:24:26.848 --> 00:24:28.459
If she finds out that I'm not Joon...

429
00:24:29.318 --> 00:24:30.689
Why are you even asking that question?

430
00:24:30.689 --> 00:24:33.389
We can't catch that loser without her eyes!

431
00:24:34.929 --> 00:24:36.129
Is that all?

432
00:24:37.328 --> 00:24:38.399
What are you talking about?

433
00:24:38.399 --> 00:24:42.239
By the way, you made a big fuss about losing the capsule.

434
00:24:42.239 --> 00:24:45.209
Is it okay to leave Ha Ram alone like this?

435
00:24:48.078 --> 00:24:49.179
Oh, right.

436
00:24:49.879 --> 00:24:53.479
Goodness, she's annoying. She's so annoying!

437
00:24:59.219 --> 00:25:00.919
He didn't seem annoyed, did he?

438
00:25:00.919 --> 00:25:02.389
If he's really annoyed,

439
00:25:02.618 --> 00:25:04.558
my last name would be Annoyed...

440
00:25:05.258 --> 00:25:06.999
Where did you learn that boring pun?

441
00:25:06.999 --> 00:25:09.528
- What about Lee 07? Park 07? - Goodness.

442
00:25:09.659 --> 00:25:11.129
- Jo 07? - Stop it.

443
00:25:11.129 --> 00:25:12.798
Namgoong 07 sounds good too.

444
00:25:14.038 --> 00:25:16.439
- What about Sa 07? - That's enough.

445
00:25:16.538 --> 00:25:17.669
You brat.

446
00:25:22.278 --> 00:25:24.179
I knew it. Right?

447
00:25:24.508 --> 00:25:26.879
Where did she go again? I told her to stay home.

448
00:25:46.798 --> 00:25:47.798
What?

449
00:25:48.368 --> 00:25:50.038
When did she take this?

450
00:26:05.018 --> 00:26:06.788
Is it supposed to be my face?

451
00:26:13.129 --> 00:26:14.358
"My face"?

452
00:26:16.028 --> 00:26:17.328
This isn't my face.

453
00:26:18.399 --> 00:26:20.368
Get a hold of yourself, 444.

454
00:26:20.568 --> 00:26:23.739
This isn't me. It's Han Moo Gang, okay?

455
00:26:23.939 --> 00:26:24.939
It's not me.

456
00:26:33.179 --> 00:26:36.348
I wish I had a face too.

457
00:26:46.612 --> 00:26:48.381
Has he not come to work yet?

458
00:26:48.481 --> 00:26:51.181
He wasn't home either. Where did he go?

459
00:26:54.981 --> 00:26:56.552
How can I help you?

460
00:26:59.891 --> 00:27:02.322
- You must be here to see Moo Gang. - Yes.

461
00:27:03.292 --> 00:27:06.391
- He hasn't come to work yet. - I see.

462
00:27:08.262 --> 00:27:10.102
Shall I buy you a cup of coffee?

463
00:27:10.772 --> 00:27:12.802
No, thank you. Goodbye.

464
00:27:13.671 --> 00:27:14.671
Well...

465
00:27:14.741 --> 00:27:16.471
Gosh, she's pretty.

466
00:27:16.941 --> 00:27:19.671
But something smells fishy, right?

467
00:27:20.072 --> 00:27:22.042
There definitely is something fishy.

468
00:27:24.852 --> 00:27:27.181
What's worse is the stink of your hair.

469
00:27:27.852 --> 00:27:29.622
I'm surprised you came to work. What?

470
00:27:29.981 --> 00:27:32.721
- Gwang Gyun, what happened? - Whatever.

471
00:27:32.721 --> 00:27:35.161
The prosecution wants to forget the whole thing.

472
00:27:35.161 --> 00:27:37.891
Things are going against them, so they're giving in now.

473
00:27:37.891 --> 00:27:39.332
Those filthy jerks.

474
00:27:40.661 --> 00:27:42.901
The one who filmed that video...

475
00:27:42.901 --> 00:27:44.372
really is a lifesaver to me.

476
00:27:44.372 --> 00:27:46.602
You did something wrong too, so behave yourself.

477
00:27:47.441 --> 00:27:49.741
You should learn how to control your temper.

478
00:27:49.971 --> 00:27:52.711
Are you a dog? Are you really a crazy dog?

479
00:27:52.772 --> 00:27:55.112
Why do you keep biting people?

480
00:27:55.342 --> 00:27:56.881
Well, I am a dog indeed,

481
00:27:57.211 --> 00:28:00.421
but I'm a different kind of dog from those filthy animals.

482
00:28:00.681 --> 00:28:02.122
I hope you're proud.

483
00:28:03.721 --> 00:28:04.921
Get back to work.

484
00:28:05.822 --> 00:28:07.262
Do you remember anyone particular?

485
00:28:08.122 --> 00:28:09.292
No.

486
00:28:10.092 --> 00:28:11.292
Hey, who is that?

487
00:28:11.691 --> 00:28:15.062
It's for the assault case of the bar hostess. She's a testifier.

488
00:28:15.062 --> 00:28:18.502
Don't even look at anything involved in that case! We'll deal with it.

489
00:28:18.502 --> 00:28:21.971
You should just go behave yourself or sleep out in the open.

490
00:28:21.971 --> 00:28:23.272
All right.

491
00:28:26.711 --> 00:28:29.042
So is this the report on Han Jin Sook's case?

492
00:28:29.542 --> 00:28:30.651
I think so.

493
00:28:32.582 --> 00:28:34.151
My goodness.

494
00:28:34.481 --> 00:28:38.991
"We assume Han Jin Sook threatened Woo Byung Sik that..."

495
00:28:38.991 --> 00:28:41.961
"she will reveal his survival and his involvement in prostitution,"

496
00:28:42.221 --> 00:28:46.562
"which resulted in Woo Byung Sik murdering Han Jin Sook."

497
00:28:46.661 --> 00:28:50.032
Why did he become a detective? He should've become a novelist.

498
00:28:50.032 --> 00:28:52.302
Gwang Gyun, stay out of it.

499
00:28:53.671 --> 00:28:54.872
Fine.

500
00:28:54.872 --> 00:28:57.941
I should've let them expel him. Gosh.

501
00:28:58.471 --> 00:29:00.042
I must've been crazy.

502
00:29:07.981 --> 00:29:11.352
She's taking a vacation in Japan.

503
00:29:11.852 --> 00:29:14.221
She said she'd come back to work next week.

504
00:29:14.292 --> 00:29:15.522
That's right.

505
00:29:15.792 --> 00:29:17.862
She worked at Pumpkin Singer.

506
00:29:18.691 --> 00:29:21.062
She must know something about Clara's death.

(List of Bar Hostesses in Moojin)

508
00:29:28.842 --> 00:29:30.512
(Hwang Mi Ja, Pumpkin Singer)

509
00:29:35.481 --> 00:29:36.641
Hello?

510
00:29:39.852 --> 00:29:41.582
Hello? Who is this?

511
00:29:43.522 --> 00:29:47.221
You silly. Why would you have your wages cut because of Gwang Gyun?

512
00:29:47.362 --> 00:29:49.262
I can't understand you.

513
00:29:49.522 --> 00:29:52.762
Why do you want to keep that nuisance in your team so badly?

514
00:29:53.491 --> 00:29:56.362
He's not a nuisance. Please watch your words.

515
00:29:56.602 --> 00:29:58.901
They released the jerk who tried to kill Moo Gang.

516
00:29:58.901 --> 00:30:01.572
If Gwang Gyun hadn't bitten him, I would have.

517
00:30:01.671 --> 00:30:04.372
He knows I have weak teeth, so he bit the prosecutor instead of me.

518
00:30:04.572 --> 00:30:06.711
Look at you siding with your subordinate.

519
00:30:07.082 --> 00:30:10.141
I'm not siding with him. He's the most honest guy here.

520
00:30:10.211 --> 00:30:12.381
- Move! Move! Gosh. - My goodness.

521
00:30:15.782 --> 00:30:17.451
Is the woman done with the testimony?

522
00:30:17.451 --> 00:30:19.921
Yes. She just left after giving her testimony.

523
00:30:19.921 --> 00:30:23.731
Why did you bring such a troublesome case to our team?

524
00:30:23.731 --> 00:30:25.391
You should've just left it with the teenage crime division.

525
00:30:25.391 --> 00:30:28.201
Gosh, I can't agree with you on a single thing today.

526
00:30:28.362 --> 00:30:31.431
How can you say that? That brat swung...

527
00:30:31.431 --> 00:30:35.201
a shovel at Moo Gang. How could I let anyone else investigate it?

528
00:30:35.201 --> 00:30:37.072
I should take Moo Gang's revenge.

529
00:30:37.072 --> 00:30:41.842
Gosh, you said you wanted to fire him not so long ago.

530
00:30:42.342 --> 00:30:44.812
Hey, you should be careful yourself.

531
00:30:44.812 --> 00:30:48.681
You might not stop at losing hair but end up losing your job too.

532
00:30:49.082 --> 00:30:52.522
You're dealing with Royeol. Even the prosecution doesn't mess with them.

533
00:30:52.721 --> 00:30:55.022
Don't you know who is behind that group?

534
00:30:55.262 --> 00:30:57.891
It's Senator Nam Joong Pyo, the strongest presidential candidate.

535
00:30:58.191 --> 00:30:59.961
The presidential election is soon.

536
00:31:00.191 --> 00:31:01.961
If they mess with my boys,

537
00:31:01.961 --> 00:31:03.931
I would even investigate the Blue House.

538
00:31:03.931 --> 00:31:04.931
How dare they?

539
00:31:04.931 --> 00:31:07.342
A presidential candidate? Do you think he'd scare me?

540
00:31:07.342 --> 00:31:10.171
Gosh, Captain Bong. How great.

541
00:31:10.812 --> 00:31:13.612
You're right. If they mess with Moo Gang,

542
00:31:13.612 --> 00:31:15.711
I'll destroy them even if it's the Blue House...

543
00:31:15.711 --> 00:31:17.451
or the White House.

544
00:31:17.451 --> 00:31:20.381
Your team is just helpless.

545
00:31:20.552 --> 00:31:22.481
From head to tail,

546
00:31:22.481 --> 00:31:24.891
you're all lunatics.

547
00:31:26.122 --> 00:31:27.262
Lunatics?

548
00:31:27.461 --> 00:31:29.522
Hey. Sir!

549
00:31:30.122 --> 00:31:32.092
Gosh, Captain Bong is so cool.

550
00:31:33.292 --> 00:31:34.631
My goodness!

551
00:31:36.862 --> 00:31:38.971
Is it you again, Moo Gang?

552
00:31:39.431 --> 00:31:40.872
Seriously.

553
00:31:40.901 --> 00:31:42.842
But aren't you on sick leave?

554
00:31:43.201 --> 00:31:45.072
I didn't know you were coming to work today.

555
00:31:47.582 --> 00:31:49.842
- Did Kang Ha Ram come here? - Kang Ha Ram?

556
00:31:50.451 --> 00:31:53.951
Oh, that girl? Gui Nam said he saw her in front of our office.

557
00:31:53.951 --> 00:31:55.052
Really?

558
00:31:58.721 --> 00:32:00.461
Gosh, what? What is it?

559
00:32:06.562 --> 00:32:08.931
Take it back. We're not lunatics.

560
00:32:08.961 --> 00:32:11.372
I've never heard that kind of insult.

561
00:32:14.002 --> 00:32:17.042
What on earth... Moo Gang! What did you just do?

562
00:32:18.872 --> 00:32:20.072
Short-legged Grandpa.

563
00:32:20.842 --> 00:32:21.981
I called you a pervert before.

564
00:32:23.042 --> 00:32:24.052
I take it back.

565
00:32:26.312 --> 00:32:27.951
Gosh, that lunatic.

566
00:32:27.951 --> 00:32:30.022
I'm really going to fire you!

567
00:32:31.322 --> 00:32:32.651
Goodness.

568
00:32:33.862 --> 00:32:35.292
Let's go down and check.

569
00:32:39.362 --> 00:32:41.701
- My gosh. - What is this?

570
00:32:49.002 --> 00:32:50.201
Stop the work!

571
00:32:50.201 --> 00:32:52.312
- Stop the work! - Stop the work!

572
00:32:52.312 --> 00:32:53.812
Turn off the engine!

573
00:32:53.812 --> 00:32:55.181
- What? - What's going on?

574
00:32:55.681 --> 00:32:56.681
What on earth is that?

575
00:32:57.052 --> 00:32:58.082
What's that?

576
00:32:58.181 --> 00:32:59.612
Yes, I'll be right there.

577
00:32:59.852 --> 00:33:01.052
Doctor.

578
00:33:02.082 --> 00:33:03.451
Doctor... Doctor.

579
00:33:05.391 --> 00:33:08.221
Please tell them what you saw.

580
00:33:08.221 --> 00:33:09.622
Why are you doing this to me?

581
00:33:09.622 --> 00:33:11.232
I told you that I really didn't see anything.

582
00:33:11.991 --> 00:33:14.301
Doctor. Please listen to me.

583
00:33:14.602 --> 00:33:16.861
- My son, Kyung Soo... - I have to get back to work.

584
00:33:16.861 --> 00:33:18.531
- Take care then. - Doctor.

585
00:33:27.141 --> 00:33:31.082
What... What should we do? I don't think she has eaten in days.

586
00:33:31.082 --> 00:33:34.152
She won't starve to death like that, right?

587
00:33:34.221 --> 00:33:35.352
You're doing it again.

588
00:33:35.352 --> 00:33:38.192
Can we ask Black to bring Ha Ram...

589
00:33:38.321 --> 00:33:41.861
so that she can foresee how that woman dies?

590
00:33:41.922 --> 00:33:42.922
Then what?

591
00:33:43.062 --> 00:33:44.431
You never know.

592
00:33:44.562 --> 00:33:48.462
Ha Ram might save that woman's life.

593
00:33:48.462 --> 00:33:50.772
What a great grim reaper you are.

594
00:33:51.301 --> 00:33:52.872
How dare you forget your identity!

595
00:34:00.982 --> 00:34:02.882
What... What's wrong with me?

596
00:34:03.542 --> 00:34:04.681
Something's wrong with my body.

597
00:34:08.551 --> 00:34:10.321
Gosh, what's going on with my body?

598
00:34:30.341 --> 00:34:32.971
Where in the world is he? And why isn't he picking up all day?

599
00:34:32.971 --> 00:34:36.042
Stop the construction of Royeol Complex Shopping Mall!

600
00:34:36.042 --> 00:34:37.812
- Stop it! - Stop it!

601
00:34:37.812 --> 00:34:40.681
We must not repeat the tragedy of Moojin Time Mart!

602
00:34:40.681 --> 00:34:42.352
- We must not repeat! - We must not repeat!

603
00:34:42.352 --> 00:34:44.652
- What? "Moojin Time Mart"? - Everyone!

604
00:34:44.652 --> 00:34:46.821
Thanks to the sacrifice of Park Seung Chul's parents,

605
00:34:46.821 --> 00:34:48.422
- That's Congressman Kim Young Seok. - we were able to find out that...

606
00:34:48.422 --> 00:34:52.431
Woo Byung Sik's death had actually been fabricated 20 years ago.

607
00:34:52.632 --> 00:34:54.832
Who do you think helped Woo Byung Sik...

608
00:34:54.832 --> 00:34:57.732
stay alive in secret for 20 years?

609
00:34:57.732 --> 00:34:59.471
We must find out...

610
00:34:59.471 --> 00:35:03.372
who helped Woo Byung Sik run away and supported him to stay alive.

611
00:35:03.372 --> 00:35:06.841
And Royeol must also reveal the truth behind...

612
00:35:06.841 --> 00:35:09.611
the Moojin Time Mart incident and why it ended up collapsing.

613
00:35:09.611 --> 00:35:12.582
Until then, they must halt the construction!

614
00:35:12.582 --> 00:35:14.821
- Halt the construction! - Halt the construction!

615
00:35:14.821 --> 00:35:18.122
We wish to talk to Vice-chairman Oh Man Ho!

616
00:35:18.122 --> 00:35:20.252
- We wish to talk to him! - We wish to talk to him!

617
00:35:20.292 --> 00:35:21.962
- Let's go! - Let's go!

I'm pretty sure you were a beagle in your past life.

623

Stand up.

- What? - What?

628
00:36:08.971 --> 00:36:11.212
- What? - They found a button.

629
00:36:11.611 --> 00:36:13.542
And it's the button from Moojin Middle School's uniform.

630
00:36:13.542 --> 00:36:16.712
Could... Could it be my son, Hyun Soo?

It might be Seung Chul. We should go too.

That man's son?

636
00:36:33.661 --> 00:36:35.062
You worked at a place called...

637
00:36:35.062 --> 00:36:37.931
Pumpkin Singer in Moojin 20 years ago, didn't you?

638
00:36:37.931 --> 00:36:39.201
Yes. So?

639
00:36:39.201 --> 00:36:42.971
Was the manager close to anyone who seemed suspicious?

640
00:36:42.971 --> 00:36:44.442
Or did you ever notice anything odd about her?

641
00:36:45.372 --> 00:36:48.341
Clara? Why do you ask?

642
00:36:49.841 --> 00:36:52.482
It's quite typical for women working in pubs.

643
00:36:52.482 --> 00:36:55.382
They have a lot of guys around them and lots of enemies.

644
00:36:55.821 --> 00:36:59.152
Did she leave with a guy when she left Moojin?

645
00:36:59.491 --> 00:37:01.591
Or was there anything odd about her?

646
00:37:02.522 --> 00:37:04.261
She didn't leave with a guy.

647
00:37:04.462 --> 00:37:07.502
But she did flee with them in the middle of the night.

648
00:37:07.801 --> 00:37:08.832
"Them"?

649
00:37:08.832 --> 00:37:11.571
Yes. She fled with Jin Sook.

650
00:37:11.571 --> 00:37:13.471
"Jin Sook"? Do you mean Han Jin Sook?

651
00:37:14.102 --> 00:37:16.801
Are you saying Clara ran away with Han Jin Sook?

652
00:37:16.801 --> 00:37:20.241
Yes, they ran away with all our money.

653
00:37:20.241 --> 00:37:22.042
Those cunning brats.

654
00:37:22.042 --> 00:37:24.352
I thought you kept in touch with Han Jin Sook in Seoul.

655
00:37:24.352 --> 00:37:25.812
I heard you even gave her husband a job.

00:37:25.812 --> 00:37:30.491
Yes, I met her by coincidence in Seoul.

657
00:37:30.792 --> 00:37:34.321
Then did Han Jin Sook tell you anything about Clara?

658
00:37:34.321 --> 00:37:36.692
She said they parted ways with each other as soon as they came to Seoul.

659
00:37:36.692 --> 00:37:38.562
She said she hadn't kept in touch with her ever since.

660
00:37:40.332 --> 00:37:42.462
Wait a minute. You said "Them".

661
00:37:42.462 --> 00:37:44.632
Does that mean there was someone else other than Han Jin Sook?

662
00:37:45.701 --> 00:37:46.701
That's right.

663
00:37:47.772 --> 00:37:50.641
She was one of the newbies in the pub.

664
00:37:51.712 --> 00:37:55.042
She always wore a neat uniform.

665
00:37:56.212 --> 00:37:57.982
She was very pretty.

666
00:37:58.712 --> 00:38:02.252
All the customers were practically drooling over her.

667
00:38:03.181 --> 00:38:05.451
My gosh, what a bunch of animals.

668
00:38:06.622 --> 00:38:09.861
Then what happened to her?

669
00:38:09.861 --> 00:38:12.062
Did she not say anything about Han Jin Sook?

670
00:38:12.062 --> 00:38:14.332
They also parted ways when they came to Seoul.

671
00:38:15.102 --> 00:38:17.602
So they also hadn't met each other ever since.

672
00:38:18.502 --> 00:38:22.372
Then do you remember her name?

673
00:38:22.701 --> 00:38:25.111
Her name? What was her name again?

674
00:38:25.812 --> 00:38:27.741
It was a very common name.

675
00:38:29.181 --> 00:38:31.681
Sun... Sun Hee.

676
00:38:33.852 --> 00:38:36.721
Sun Young. It... It was Kim Sun Young.

677
00:38:37.951 --> 00:38:39.422
Yes, that's right.

678
00:38:40.192 --> 00:38:41.891
- Kim Sun Young? - Yes.

679
00:38:45.562 --> 00:38:46.891
Kim Sun Young.

680
00:38:55.542 --> 00:38:57.312
Good thinking, Sun Young.

681
00:38:59.571 --> 00:39:01.911
Are you telling me that you saw that video?

682
00:39:02.882 --> 00:39:06.181
Moo Gang... Moo Gang had it.

683
00:39:06.982 --> 00:39:10.221
So I thought he kept it in the storage room.

684
00:39:10.221 --> 00:39:11.321
Come here.

685
00:39:12.922 --> 00:39:14.522
Should we start all over again?

686
00:39:14.522 --> 00:39:16.321
We couldn't find anything else there other than...

687
00:39:16.321 --> 00:39:18.332
the videotape where you were taking your clothes off!

688
00:39:18.531 --> 00:39:19.661
He...

689
00:39:20.332 --> 00:39:22.062
He probably hid it somewhere else.

690
00:39:22.062 --> 00:39:24.201
I'll... I'll find it for you.

691
00:39:24.971 --> 00:39:26.471
Moo Gang lost his memory,

692
00:39:26.471 --> 00:39:29.172
so he won't be able to reveal it to anyone anyway.

693
00:39:29.471 --> 00:39:32.212
I'll naturally approach him,

694
00:39:32.272 --> 00:39:33.712
and I'll get it back for you.

695
00:39:34.281 --> 00:39:37.212
I also don't want that videotape out in the open...

696
00:39:37.582 --> 00:39:40.181
as much as you guys.

697
00:39:40.181 --> 00:39:41.382
You know that.

698
00:39:45.551 --> 00:39:47.462
If you try to do anything funny,

699
00:39:47.661 --> 00:39:49.861
I'm going to cut off all your arms and legs. Do you understand?

700
00:39:54.962 --> 00:39:58.102
(Student Record, Moojin Girls’ Middle School)

701
00:40:03.571 --> 00:40:05.611
- Excuse me. - Yes?

702
00:40:05.611 --> 00:40:09.582
- Why is there a ripped page? - There's a ripped page? What?

703
00:40:09.582 --> 00:40:11.681
- There's a missing page here. - That can't be.

704
00:40:12.212 --> 00:40:14.852
The last detective who came here also asked me about that page.

705
00:40:15.281 --> 00:40:17.051
What? What detective?

706
00:40:17.051 --> 00:40:19.091
A handsome detective came and asked me...

707
00:40:19.091 --> 00:40:20.821
to show him the student record of 1997.

708
00:40:20.821 --> 00:40:23.622
He also asked about the same missing page.

709
00:40:24.361 --> 00:40:28.402
By any chance, was he looking for a student named Kim Sun Young?

710
00:40:28.402 --> 00:40:29.902
Yes, it was Kim Sun Young.

711
00:40:31.172 --> 00:40:32.672
Do you remember who that detective was?

712
00:40:32.672 --> 00:40:35.272
Well, I think I got his name card.

713
00:40:35.272 --> 00:40:38.141
Just a second. I wonder if I threw it away.

714
00:40:39.641 --> 00:40:41.042
Oh, here it is.

715
00:40:41.141 --> 00:40:42.712
Thank you.

716
00:40:43.341 --> 00:40:44.352
Moo Gang?

717
00:40:46.712 --> 00:40:48.582
When did he come here?

718
00:40:48.582 --> 00:40:52.792
Well, it was the day after the school's anniversary.

719
00:40:53.091 --> 00:40:54.622
So it was September 20.

720
00:40:55.491 --> 00:40:56.761
September 20?

721
00:40:59.361 --> 00:41:01.002
September 20.

722
00:41:02.102 --> 00:41:05.071
That's about a month before he got into an accident.

723
00:41:08.102 --> 00:41:10.672
What in the world was he trying to find out?

724
00:41:14.042 --> 00:41:15.442
The doctor's here!

725
00:41:15.982 --> 00:41:17.252
- Come on! - Let's go.

726
00:41:18.082 --> 00:41:20.852
It's going to take a few days for the DNA results to come out.

727
00:41:21.022 --> 00:41:22.781
But we compared the dental records...

728
00:41:22.781 --> 00:41:24.652
of the missing person with the skeleton's teeth.

729
00:41:25.252 --> 00:41:26.652
And the skeleton that was found today...

730
00:41:26.652 --> 00:41:29.721
at the construction site of Royeol Complex Shopping Mall...

731
00:41:30.732 --> 00:41:34.531
turned out to be Jang Hyun Soo of Moojin Middle School.

732
00:41:34.531 --> 00:41:35.801
- Hyun Soo... - My gosh.

733
00:41:35.801 --> 00:41:37.672
- My goodness. Hyun Soo. - Hyun Soo.

734
00:41:37.672 --> 00:41:38.931
Honey, what should we do?

735
00:41:38.931 --> 00:41:41.241
My gosh. Hyun Soo. Hyun Soo.

736
00:41:41.241 --> 00:41:43.911
What? What's wrong with me?

737
00:41:51.181 --> 00:41:54.382
Why have I turned into someone else?

738
00:41:55.582 --> 00:41:57.991
They must've finally found you.

739
00:41:58.622 --> 00:42:01.562
What? What does that mean?

740
00:42:01.562 --> 00:42:04.632
Congratulations on being found.

741
00:42:05.462 --> 00:42:06.891
Jang Hyun Soo.

742
00:42:07.232 --> 00:42:08.661
"Jang Hyun Soo"?

743
00:42:08.661 --> 00:42:12.332
How you look right now is your true self.

744
00:42:14.772 --> 00:42:15.772
What?

745
00:42:20.712 --> 00:42:22.312
My goodness. Hyun Soo!

746
00:42:22.312 --> 00:42:25.582
My gosh. Honey, what should we do?

747
00:42:25.812 --> 00:42:28.051
What should we do? It was Hyun Soo.

748
00:42:28.051 --> 00:42:30.422
- I guess it wasn't Seung Chul. - Our poor son, Hyun Soo.

749
00:42:34.922 --> 00:42:35.922
Where are you going?

750
00:42:37.761 --> 00:42:39.091
Since I'm at Moojin,

751
00:42:39.091 --> 00:42:41.531
I should go say hello to Seung Chul's parents.

752
00:42:44.732 --> 00:42:46.402
And I should give them this photo while I'm there.

753
00:42:59.781 --> 00:43:01.582
Mr. Park. Ms. Kim.

754
00:43:01.922 --> 00:43:04.051
Woo Byung Sik's also dead now.

755
00:43:06.022 --> 00:43:07.861
So just forget about everything,

756
00:43:08.761 --> 00:43:13.062
and live a happy life with Seung Chul in paradise.

What's this?

761
00:43:50.672 --> 00:43:52.232
Kim Joon's here too?

762
00:43:56.372 --> 00:43:57.712
Detective Han?

763
00:44:00.982 --> 00:44:03.411
What? Do you know me?

764
00:44:05.951 --> 00:44:08.982
No. I think I mistook you for someone else.

765
00:44:09.781 --> 00:44:10.792
I'm sorry.

766
00:44:17.891 --> 00:44:18.891
What was that?

767
00:44:25.872 --> 00:44:27.772
I guess he really can't remember anything.

768
00:44:28.272 --> 00:44:29.672
Joon.

769
00:44:30.741 --> 00:44:31.741

What are you doing here?

00:44:49.891 --> 00:44:52.132
Nothing. Let's go.

774
00:44:52.591 --> 00:44:53.591
Okay.

775
00:44:55.761 --> 00:44:57.132
I wonder if I misheard that.

776
00:45:00.942 --> 00:45:01.942
But...

777
00:45:03.641 --> 00:45:05.071
how did he know Joon was here...

778
00:45:05.071 --> 00:45:08.212
when he can't even remember anything?

779
00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:19.510
Hey, when does Moo Gang start coming to work again?

780
00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:21.150
He's not coming until next week.

781
00:45:26.079 --> 00:45:28.519
- Hey, Captain Bong. - Yes?

782
00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:31.119
Did you ever give Moo Gang a case without letting me know?

783
00:45:32.619 --> 00:45:35.090
- What? - Did you give him a case?

784
00:45:35.090 --> 00:45:38.530
Why don't you try using your brain?

785
00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:41.700
He's been acting crazy ever since he lost his memory.

786
00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:43.499
Why would I give that kind of guy a case?

787
00:45:43.939 --> 00:45:47.369
I'm talking about before that. I'm talking about before the accident.

788
00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:51.539
I told you to try using your brain.

789
00:45:51.539 --> 00:45:53.849
He threw up every time when he saw a corpse.

790
00:45:53.849 --> 00:45:57.180
So why would I trust him with any kind of case at all? Gosh.

791
00:45:57.579 --> 00:46:00.180
- My gosh. - You brat.

792
00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:07.360
Why did you become a detective when you're not even apt for it?

793
00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:09.590
Why are you making so many people suffer because of that?

794
00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:11.630
You graduated from a prestigious university in the States,

795
00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:13.430
and you used to be a successful accountant.

796
00:46:13.829 --> 00:46:15.570
There was something I must do.

797
00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:18.340
What would be that something he just had to do?

798
00:46:21.309 --> 00:46:24.079
What were you investigating by yourself, Moo Gang?

799
00:47:14.590 --> 00:47:17.260
We shouldn't have met back then.

800
00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:29.709
I'm a bit late, aren't I?

801
00:47:31.439 --> 00:47:32.709
I'm sorry, big brother.

802
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:34.510
Big brother?

803
00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:37.380
Then was he Joon's younger brother?

804
00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:39.320
I should've visited earlier.

805
00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:42.150
But it turned out to be like this.

806
00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:44.260
(Han Moo Chan)

807
00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:46.220
You're still very handsome.

808
00:47:51.059 --> 00:47:52.300
I'll come see you again.

809
00:48:01.039 --> 00:48:02.369
He got stabbed in his stomach.

810
00:48:03.369 --> 00:48:04.380
To the left.

811
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:15.519
You can go home now.

812
00:48:15.519 --> 00:48:17.090
Shouldn't I stay for a few more days?

813
00:48:18.689 --> 00:48:19.919
Why are you here again?

814
00:48:19.919 --> 00:48:22.360
Well, my hand got seriously injured.

815
00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:28.130
What is it this time?

816
00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:30.570
Well... I'm here because of this.

817
00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:33.070
A mosquito bit me.

818
00:48:52.419 --> 00:48:55.689
What kind of detective gets beaten up so badly by a bunch of gangsters?

819
00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:02.400
Does it hurt anywhere else?

820
00:49:02.829 --> 00:49:04.200
Yes... Yes, it does.

821
00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:06.240
Really? Where?

822
00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:08.740
Here.

823
00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:10.510
You got hit in the chest as well?

824
00:49:10.539 --> 00:49:13.180
- Then let's take an X-ray... - No, no.

825
00:49:13.749 --> 00:49:14.950
No, that's not what I meant.

826
00:49:16.079 --> 00:49:17.249
My heart...

827
00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:20.519
- is beating. - What?

828
00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:22.650
My heart's beating like crazy.

829
00:49:25.889 --> 00:49:26.889
Wait...

830
00:49:32.559 --> 00:49:33.599
Right?

831
00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:37.800
I shouldn't have met him back then.

832
00:49:40.539 --> 00:49:43.110
If I treated him coldheartedly back then,

833
00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:47.809
things wouldn't have come this far.

834
00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:54.919
I have no other choice now.

835
00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:13.300
Thank you for today, Joon.

836
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:15.110
Go home safely.

837
00:50:15.110 --> 00:50:18.309
Stay home until I call you tomorrow. Okay?

838
00:50:34.530 --> 00:50:37.860
Joon's the only person who cares about me.

839
00:50:59.150 --> 00:51:00.220
You saw it, didn't you?

840
00:51:01.519 --> 00:51:03.220
You saw a shadow on him, didn't you?

841
00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:04.990
I'm talking about Hoon Seok's dad.

842
00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:08.090
You saw something that day, didn't you?

843
00:51:11.999 --> 00:51:13.360
I don't know.

844
00:51:16.099 --> 00:51:17.099
No.

845
00:51:17.639 --> 00:51:19.070
He can't die.

846
00:51:26.139 --> 00:51:29.880
Do you still like that jerk even after getting beaten up by him?

847
00:51:30.209 --> 00:51:32.320
I guess you can't last a day without a man.

848
00:51:32.619 --> 00:51:35.019
You have no pride when it comes to men, do you?

849
00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:38.019
Hoon Seok's sick.

850
00:51:42.689 --> 00:51:43.930
That poor boy...

851
00:51:45.829 --> 00:51:47.030
has leukemia.

852
00:51:48.669 --> 00:51:49.669
What?

853
00:51:49.669 --> 00:51:51.369
Thankfully, his marrow matches with his dad's,

854
00:51:51.369 --> 00:51:52.840
so his dad agreed to donate it to him.

855
00:51:53.269 --> 00:51:54.510
But I can't get a hold of his dad...

856
00:51:55.169 --> 00:51:58.209
ever since he left home saying that he'll earn money for the surgery.

857
00:52:00.079 --> 00:52:01.249
You saw the shadow, didn't you?

858
00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:04.979
You know where and how...

859
00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:07.749
- he's going to die, don't you? - Are you...

860
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:11.289
asking me to save that jerk?

861
00:52:11.289 --> 00:52:13.419
If he dies, Hoon Seok will die as well.

862
00:52:16.789 --> 00:52:18.499
Do you see this?

863
00:52:20.229 --> 00:52:22.130
I almost died while trying save someone.

864
00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:25.039
You don't care about what happens to me, do you?

865
00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:29.269
You try so hard to save that boy when he's not even your real son.

866
00:52:30.139 --> 00:52:32.880
But you don't even care whether your real daughter dies or not.

867
00:52:35.209 --> 00:52:38.349
Do you love that jerk's love child that much?

868
00:54:18.519 --> 00:54:20.249
If he used to pig out that much,

869
00:54:21.189 --> 00:54:23.249
shouldn't he be healthy from all the food he's eaten?

870
00:54:24.019 --> 00:54:26.419
Is he a protagonist in a tragic novel or what?

871
00:54:26.619 --> 00:54:28.630
Why does it have to be leukemia out of all diseases?

872
00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:06.959
Why am I your sister? We don't even share a single drop of blood.

873
00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:32.459
All right, I shall at least watch how you'll die.

874
00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:37.860
What's he doing?

875
00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:41.769
Darn it. Taxi, taxi!

876
00:55:47.110 --> 00:55:49.010
You spent all of your hard-earned money on gambling.

877
00:55:49.010 --> 00:55:50.910
You can't even afford to pay for your son's surgery?

878
00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:54.450
I'll do anything you need me to do, so please pay me up front.

879
00:55:54.450 --> 00:55:56.550
I have no money.

880
00:55:56.550 --> 00:55:58.650
Gosh. Don't be like that, please.

881
00:55:58.650 --> 00:56:00.450
Please help me out here.

882
00:56:00.450 --> 00:56:03.220
I can smash and tear down everything.

883
00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:05.789
Not everyone can do this job. Gosh.

884
00:56:06.419 --> 00:56:08.289
I said that I'll do anything. Please help me out.

885
00:56:08.289 --> 00:56:09.829
My goodness.

886
00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:13.930
(Sun Employment Agency)

887
00:56:14.430 --> 00:56:15.769
Gosh, that startled me.

888
00:56:17.999 --> 00:56:19.740
(Loser)

889
00:56:20.099 --> 00:56:21.369
Hey, Joon.

890
00:56:21.369 --> 00:56:22.939
Where are you now?

891
00:56:23.369 --> 00:56:25.410
I told you not to go anywhere and stay home.

892
00:56:25.410 --> 00:56:27.880
Where did you go at the crack of dawn?

893
00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:30.680
What?

894
00:56:31.950 --> 00:56:32.950
Where?

895
00:56:37.519 --> 00:56:38.789
Have you found anything yet?

896
00:56:39.119 --> 00:56:42.430
Oh, I was just about to call you. You came at the perfect time.

897
00:56:42.959 --> 00:56:45.559
Here. Have a look at this.

898
00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:50.070
A minute amount of arsenous acid was found in the teeth in the skull.

899
00:56:50.130 --> 00:56:51.570
What's arsenous acid?

900
00:56:51.570 --> 00:56:53.700
It's an arsenic compound...

901
00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:56.169
that gets easily accumulated in the skin or bones,

902
00:56:56.169 --> 00:56:59.180
so it can be found in the body even a few years after death.

903
00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:01.010
In the past, it was used...

904
00:57:01.010 --> 00:57:03.709
in things like preservatives, dyes, insecticides,

905
00:57:03.709 --> 00:57:05.019
and so on,

906
00:57:05.019 --> 00:57:07.820
but its harmful effects were confirmed in 1986,

907
00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:10.090
so its production has been banned in the country ever since.

908
00:57:10.090 --> 00:57:12.189
- 1986? - Yes.

909
00:57:12.590 --> 00:57:13.760
Hang on a second.

910
00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:16.889
Then it's been over 30 years since they stopped making...

911
00:57:16.889 --> 00:57:19.360
arsenous acid or whatever it's called.

912
00:57:19.530 --> 00:57:22.900
But the skeleton is from someone who died 20 years ago.

913
00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:24.570
It doesn't add up.

914
00:57:24.570 --> 00:57:26.439
I looked further into it and found out...

915
00:57:26.669 --> 00:57:29.740
that a dye manufacturing factory got caught while using it illegally...

916
00:57:29.740 --> 00:57:32.939
in 1996 and was shut down as a result.

917
00:57:36.349 --> 00:57:38.050
I think that person...

918
00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:41.189
was killed there.

919
00:57:42.289 --> 00:57:43.720
Where's that factory?

920
00:57:45.919 --> 00:57:47.860
- Moojin. - Moojin?

921
00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:53.869
Yes, I prepared everything according to the plan.

922
00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:55.900
We'll leave now.

923
00:57:57.139 --> 00:57:59.570
I want to go too. Please take me. I can do a great job.

924
00:57:59.570 --> 00:58:01.869
Gosh, you may get injured.

925
00:58:01.869 --> 00:58:04.410
My son might die. I don't care whether I get injured or not.

926
00:58:04.410 --> 00:58:06.709
All right, then. We're going to leave now, so follow me.

927
00:58:06.709 --> 00:58:08.150
- Thank you. - Let's go, guys.

928
00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:11.180
Get moving. Hurry up.

929
00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:12.780
Let's go.

930
00:58:13.849 --> 00:58:14.849
Hurry up.

931
00:58:15.590 --> 00:58:17.260
Get in. Go on.

932
00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:19.160
Get in, guys.

933
00:58:22.930 --> 00:58:23.930
What's going on?

934
00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:26.260
I see the shadow on that man too.

935
00:58:27.869 --> 00:58:29.729
Who are all those people?

936
00:58:31.970 --> 00:58:33.499
Where are they going?

937
00:58:34.369 --> 00:58:36.240
- What should I do? - What are you going to do?

938
00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:37.410
Joon.

939
00:58:43.150 --> 00:58:45.280
Joon. You brought your car, right?

940
00:58:45.979 --> 00:58:46.979
Follow me.

941
00:58:49.389 --> 00:58:53.289
Everyone is expressing their condolences to commemorate...

942
00:58:53.289 --> 00:58:55.789
the Moojin Time Mart collapse victim found after 20 years.

943
00:58:55.789 --> 00:58:58.260
The President and other influential figures...

944
00:58:58.260 --> 00:59:00.470
are visiting the mortuary in Moojin...

945
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:02.329
to console the bereaved.

946
00:59:11.010 --> 00:59:12.139
I...

947
00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:15.749
- I just... - Honey...

948
00:59:15.749 --> 00:59:16.950
remembered everything.

949
00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:18.720
Don't go.

950
00:59:20.519 --> 00:59:21.619
Please don't go there.

951
00:59:21.619 --> 00:59:23.490
Hey, Seung Chul.

952
00:59:23.490 --> 00:59:25.289
The school bell rings

953
00:59:25.289 --> 00:59:27.430
Our class is about to start

954
00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:29.930
If we're late, we'll get in trouble

955
00:59:29.930 --> 00:59:30.930
Let's go.

956
00:59:30.930 --> 00:59:32.430
All right, Hyun Soo. Let's go together.

957
00:59:32.430 --> 00:59:34.499
Don't... Don't go. Don't go there.

958
00:59:34.499 --> 00:59:36.400
Okay, I won't go to the movies.

959
00:59:36.930 --> 00:59:38.200
Seung Chul!

960
00:59:38.499 --> 00:59:39.769
What's the matter with that kid?

961
00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:41.639
It's nothing.

962
00:59:42.669 --> 00:59:43.669
Hyun Soo.

963
00:59:44.209 --> 00:59:47.079
Will you go to the movies tomorrow?

964
00:59:47.110 --> 00:59:49.709
Of course. I've been dying to watch the movie.

965
00:59:50.749 --> 00:59:52.919
Oh, no. We're late.

966
00:59:53.550 --> 00:59:55.019
(Moojin Time Mart)

967
00:59:56.590 --> 00:59:59.590
- Hey, come here! - Help!

968
01:00:11.139 --> 01:00:14.309
What... What should we do now, Seung Chul?

969
01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:15.939
I'm so stunned...

970
01:00:17.209 --> 01:00:19.910
that I can't even feel the pain.

971
01:00:25.050 --> 01:00:26.450
I guess the doctors...

972
01:00:27.450 --> 01:00:29.320
will stitch them up.

973
01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:30.519
By the way,

974
01:00:31.959 --> 01:00:33.419
my mom will be...

975
01:00:34.329 --> 01:00:36.289
so upset if she sees this.

976
01:00:38.229 --> 01:00:41.030
Will we die like this, Seung Chul?

977
01:00:41.769 --> 01:00:43.599
What are you talking about?

978
01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:48.610
I'm sure that the adults will come and rescue us.

979
01:00:50.709 --> 01:00:53.439
Don't move. Try to stay still.

980
01:00:53.439 --> 01:00:55.809
My mom wanted me to eat breakfast,

981
01:00:56.450 --> 01:00:59.019
so she followed me with a bowl of rice in her hand,

982
01:01:01.019 --> 01:01:02.619
but I threw a tantrum at her...

983
01:01:03.519 --> 01:01:05.559
and said that I don't want to eat it.

984
01:01:05.919 --> 01:01:07.760
Just make sure you eat...

985
01:01:08.729 --> 01:01:10.459
breakfast every day starting tomorrow.

986
01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:13.700
I'll be able to do that, right?

987
01:01:19.470 --> 01:01:21.340
No!

988
01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:29.450
What happened?

989
01:01:29.979 --> 01:01:33.450
I didn't think that I used to be a human.

990
01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:38.059
I thought... I thought that I was born as the Grim Reaper.

991
01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:39.559
The truth is...

992
01:01:40.729 --> 01:01:42.930
that we all used to be humans.

993
01:01:45.059 --> 01:01:48.269
All of us who believe that they were born as Grim Reapers...

994
01:01:48.499 --> 01:01:51.999
used to be humans just like those who took their own lives.

995
01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:55.840
Then... What are we?

996
01:01:56.740 --> 01:01:59.880
We didn't take our own lives. Then what are we?

997
01:02:00.450 --> 01:02:02.809
Exactly what are we?

998
01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:07.619
Missing people.

999
01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:10.860
Missing... Missing people?

1000
01:02:12.559 --> 01:02:13.559
That's right.

1001
01:02:13.559 --> 01:02:16.530
We're not in the human form like those who took their own lives...

1002
01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:20.669
because our bodies have gone missing.

1003
01:02:21.769 --> 01:02:23.269
Our bodies...

1004
01:02:23.939 --> 01:02:26.900
are all deeply buried somewhere.

1005
01:02:29.309 --> 01:02:31.410
At the very moment...

1006
01:02:32.079 --> 01:02:34.280
when a missing body...

1007
01:02:34.650 --> 01:02:35.650
is discovered by someone,

1008
01:02:37.579 --> 01:02:41.189
they will find their true self again just like you did now.

1009
01:02:43.689 --> 01:02:46.360
You also regain all of your lost memories...

1010
01:02:46.919 --> 01:02:48.360
as well.

1011
01:02:50.729 --> 01:02:52.300
My number is 416.

1012
01:02:52.930 --> 01:02:55.470
Then is it because...

1013
01:02:56.430 --> 01:02:57.539
That's right.

1014
01:02:58.470 --> 01:03:00.070
You died on that date.

1015
01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:04.280
The number of everyone who went missing...

1016
01:03:04.979 --> 01:03:07.450
is the date of their death.

1017
01:03:16.849 --> 01:03:17.860
Mom.

1018
01:03:20.459 --> 01:03:21.459
Dad.

1019
01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:26.459
Why have you gotten so old?

1020
01:03:27.769 --> 01:03:28.769
Why?

1021
01:03:32.039 --> 01:03:33.300
I'm sorry.

1022
01:04:11.579 --> 01:04:14.550
A dye manufacturing factory got caught while using it illegally...

1023
01:04:14.550 --> 01:04:17.880
in 1996 and was shut down as a result.

1024
01:04:18.079 --> 01:04:21.619
I think that person was killed there.

1025
01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:45.380
Clara.

1026
01:04:46.979 --> 01:04:48.709
She didn't run away from me.

1027
01:04:50.849 --> 01:04:52.519
She was murdered here.

1028
01:05:01.530 --> 01:05:02.990
(Welcome to the City of Moojin)

1029
01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:08.999
Moojin?

1030
01:05:10.169 --> 01:05:11.570
Why are we going to Moojin?

1031
01:05:18.579 --> 01:05:19.910
Han Moo Gang.

1032
01:05:21.010 --> 01:05:25.320
He knew that Sun Young was involved in Clara's death.

1033
01:05:29.619 --> 01:05:32.189
He might even know...

1034
01:05:33.419 --> 01:05:34.889
who killed Clara.

1035
01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:42.729
Isn't that Moo Gang?

1036
01:05:43.669 --> 01:05:44.900
Han Moo Gang.

1037
01:05:46.099 --> 01:05:47.110
Han Moo Gang!

1038
01:06:08.789 --> 01:06:09.789
What is it?

1039
01:06:09.789 --> 01:06:12.260
What do you know, you punk?

1040
01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:14.970
- What's wrong? - Try to remember. Remember it!

1041
01:06:15.930 --> 01:06:19.139
- What were you trying to find out? - Let go. Have you lost your mind?

1042
01:06:26.439 --> 01:06:29.679
Remember it now, you brat. Recall who killed this woman.

1043
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:40.089
(Medical Records)

1044
01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:48.129
Hey, what are you doing?

1045
01:07:02.250 --> 01:07:03.250
What?

1046
01:07:03.750 --> 01:07:05.479
How could 419 have done that?

1047
01:07:05.719 --> 01:07:09.389
Grim Reapers can't have a real human's face.

1048
01:07:10.589 --> 01:07:12.089
So 419...

1049
01:07:12.719 --> 01:07:14.689
was also a missing person like me.

1050
01:07:14.689 --> 01:07:17.629
As his skeletons were found,

1051
01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:20.530
he has found his true self.

1052
01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:22.530
At the site where his skeletons were found,

1053
01:07:23.429 --> 01:07:25.700
the real Han Moo Gang was present.

1054
01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:28.870
Then did he die on April 19?

1055
01:07:31.210 --> 01:07:33.809
- Did he go to paradise? - No, he was punished for his sins.

1056
01:07:33.809 --> 01:07:35.410
His sins were too much.

1057
01:07:36.009 --> 01:07:40.450
Those who play with children are never forgiven by him.

1058
01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:44.990
What about me?

1059
01:07:45.889 --> 01:07:47.389
Where will I go?

1060
01:07:47.389 --> 01:07:49.530
Of course you'll go to paradise.

1061
01:07:49.830 --> 01:07:53.059
All of your friends went to paradise.

1062
01:07:57.070 --> 01:07:59.170
Then does that mean 444...

1063
01:07:59.969 --> 01:08:01.610
was also a human being?

1064
01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:08.309
Was he also a missing person like me?

1065
01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:10.780
Yes.

1066
01:08:13.049 --> 01:08:15.019
- Repeal. - Repeal.

1067
01:08:15.019 --> 01:08:16.889
Stop the act.

1068
01:08:16.889 --> 01:08:18.860
- Stop the act. - Stop the act.

1069
01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:20.360
Repeal.

1070
01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:21.929
- Repeal. - Repeal.

1071
01:08:21.929 --> 01:08:23.860
- Those punks. - Let's go.

1072
01:08:30.939 --> 01:08:32.040
- Get them. - Yes, sir!

1073
01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:34.070
You punks!

1074
01:08:49.750 --> 01:08:50.759
What should I do?

1075
01:08:56.860 --> 01:08:57.900
- Let go of her! - What are you?

1076
01:08:58.299 --> 01:08:59.700
Stop it!

1077
01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:30.360
Ha Ram. Ha Ram!

1078
01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:32.500
Hey. Hey!

1079
01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:34.370
Hey, Han Moo Gang!

1080
01:09:46.479 --> 01:09:48.150
Ha Ram. Ha Ram!

1081
01:10:12.839 --> 01:10:15.910
Where would 444 be buried?

1082
01:10:15.910 --> 01:10:17.379
I'm not sure either.

1083
01:10:18.639 --> 01:10:20.509
He must find out himself...

1084
01:10:21.479 --> 01:10:22.809
from now on.

1085
01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:43.129
(Black)

1086
01:10:43.370 --> 01:10:45.099
Are you telling me to spare him?

1087
01:10:45.099 --> 01:10:47.210
If he dies, Hoon Seok will die as well.

1088
01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:49.639
I must find proof that he tried to kill me.

1089
01:10:49.769 --> 01:10:51.866
I think that's where he was murdered.

1090
01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:53.210
Where is that factory?

1091
01:10:53.379 --> 01:10:56.110
What were you investigating all alone, Moo Gang?

1092
01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:57.280
Joon.

1093
01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:00.320
What a great grim reaper you are. How dare you forget your identity!

1094
01:11:01.089 --> 01:11:03.960
- What were you trying to find out? - Let go. Have you lost your mind?

1095
01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:07.089
I wish I had a face too.
