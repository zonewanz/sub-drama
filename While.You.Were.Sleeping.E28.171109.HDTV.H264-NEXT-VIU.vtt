00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:09.298
(Episode 28)

2
00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:12.940
Among all the confiscated items, the bottle that had poison...

3
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.569
turned out to be the finalizing evidence for the case.

4
00:00:14.569 --> 00:00:17.380
But Myung Yi Suk pleaded innocent until the end.

5
00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.309
What did Myung Yi Suk say about the bottle?

6
00:00:19.309 --> 00:00:21.150
He said it's nonsense.

7
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.880
He said the prosecutor manipulated this.

8
00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:25.749
Manipulate?

9
00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:27.650
We can fudge your grades on your report cards.

10
00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.160
Gosh, my dad is a cop.

11
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.930
We can make sure it's not that obvious.

12
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.630
Do you think...

13
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.100
a prosecutor or an inspector can manipulate confiscated goods?

14
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.200
It's horrible.

15
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.969
Is such fabrication even possible?

16
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.969
Prosecutors have the power and means to do it.

17
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.140
Who went for the confiscations?

18
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.080
It's Mr. Choi.

19
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.650
If it was manipulated,

20
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.489
it's either Lawyer Lee or Mr. Choi.

21
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.890
If it was manipulated, it must have been Lawyer Lee.

22
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.160
Mr. Choi would never do that.

23
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.999
We're still investigating. You can't be sure of anything.

24
00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:22.209
- Excuse me. - Yes, sir.

25
00:01:22.309 --> 00:01:25.350
Please contact general affairs, get Mr. Choi's personnel records,

26
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.549
and make copies for me.

27
00:01:35.519 --> 00:01:40.590
If I get caught, I have to tell the police about your manipulation.

28
00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:42.059
Will it be okay?

29
00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.499
Let's meet up. Where shall we meet up?

30
00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:47.700
(Hae Kwang Law Firm)

31
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.870
Meet me at 9pm in your office.

32
00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.580
(Hae Kwang Law Firm)

33
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.420
You're here.

34
00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.259
How is your investigation going?

35
00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:15.330
It's going well.

36
00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:19.430
How about you, Mr. Choi? Any updates on the arsonist?

37
00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:21.640
It's more difficult that I thought.

38
00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:24.100
Mr. Choi, didn't you see the arsonist that night?

39
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.009
No, I didn't. I reached there after the fire.

40
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.080
Do you remember what Mr. Choi said to me that night?

41
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.450
He knew we went there separately.

42
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.850
If you got there after the fire started,

43
00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:39.150
how did you know that Hong Joo and I went there separately?

44
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.160
I just...

45
00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:44.930
I just guessed.

46
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.830
How did you know that we were there?

47
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.600
It was coincidental. I was passing through.

48
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.430
Mr. Choi.

49
00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:57.299
It's just... How shall I put this?

50
00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.910
It was like I received a telepathic message.

51
00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:01.640
I could tell you were in danger.

52
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.340
I have super power with me.

53
00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:08.150
Maybe it's because I went to school near Miari Ridge.

54
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.629
What brought you here at this hour?

55
00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:21.230
I have something to ask you about the arson incident.

56
00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:24.330
First, take this. I meant to give it to you, but I kept forgetting.

57
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.299
I found your power bank.

58
00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:32.640
You left your power bank in my car. The red one.

59
00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:38.480
Isn't this yours? It's red.

60
00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.480
It's mine. The red one.

61
00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:49.819
Thank you.

62
00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:52.359
What do you want to ask?

63
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.029
Didn't you say you arrested the guy who got killed by the arsonist?

64
00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:58.500
Yes.

65
00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:01.700
How many gas stations have we visited?

66
00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:05.640
This is the 36th one.

67
00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:10.279
Hello.

68
00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:20.919
Aren't you going home, sir?

69
00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:23.520
I have a consultation with my client.

70
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.989
- You can leave first. - Yes, sir.

71
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.969
Prosecutors and police are looking for the arsonist for days,

72
00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:38.210
but they haven't caught him yet.

73
00:04:38.239 --> 00:04:40.009
I've been digging everywhere, but I haven't had much progress.

74
00:04:40.239 --> 00:04:42.279
I'm hoping for a glimmer of hope.

75
00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.149
Was there anything you noticed when you arrested Jo Yoon Pyo?

76
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.480
Well...

77
00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:51.850
For someone with 10,000 dollars in cash,

78
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.450
his clothes seemed shabby.

79
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:55.960
What else?

80
00:04:57.319 --> 00:04:59.730
And the bag that had cash...

81
00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:02.129
What's with the bag?

82
00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:06.669
It's here. June 22nd. 10 litres of gasoline.

83
00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:08.839
He bought the whole bottle.

84
00:05:09.239 --> 00:05:10.540
- Nice! - Got it!

85
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.210
Did he buy in cash or credit card?

86
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.540
He paid in cash.

87
00:05:19.109 --> 00:05:22.020
Do you remember how he looked and dressed?

88
00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:28.560
I'm here.

89
00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.390
Goodness, your law firm is nice!

90
00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:33.259
You have to treat me.

91
00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:43.600
If I get caught, will you lose all of this?

92
00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.219
(Someone who has a lot also has a lot to lose.)

93
00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.330
(Someone who has a lot also has a lot to lose.)

94
00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:08.899
Someone who has a lot...

95
00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:13.600
also has a lot to lose.

96
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.109
That bag...

97
00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:28.879
seemed like a woman's.

98
00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.649
A woman's bag?

99
00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:32.790
It wasn't a man.

100
00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:35.819
It was a woman on a bicycle.

101
00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:37.790
- A woman? - A woman?

102
00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.500
You sent me the text?

103
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:44.770
Yes.

104
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.100
You seem surprised.

105
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.669
What a nice office.

106
00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:57.339
I checked on our age, and it turned out we're the same age.

107
00:06:57.879 --> 00:06:59.049
Can I speak casually?

108
00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:08.259
You won many prizes.

109
00:07:09.359 --> 00:07:10.790
Let's sit, and talk.

110
00:07:12.089 --> 00:07:13.089
Shall we?

111
00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:23.200
What was with the texts?

112
00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:25.609
Why did you look for me?

113
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:27.609
Haven't you guessed by now?

114
00:07:28.609 --> 00:07:29.980
You are smart.

115
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:31.009
No!

116
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.020
I have no clue.

117
00:07:38.719 --> 00:07:41.250
It's not that you're curious. You just want to make sure.

118
00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:44.160
It's just as what the texts say.

119
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.060
I have killed almost 20 people.

120
00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:51.359
But because of you, I didn't go to prison yet.

121
00:07:54.129 --> 00:07:55.169
I really...

122
00:07:56.839 --> 00:07:58.370
appreciate what you did.

123
00:07:59.739 --> 00:08:02.509
If the real criminal is a woman, it must be her.

124
00:08:02.739 --> 00:08:04.339
Ha Ju Won, 34 years old.

125
00:08:05.009 --> 00:08:06.210
Who is that woman?

126
00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:09.350
She was a long-term patient at the ward where the incident occurred.

127
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:10.379
A patient with Crohn's disease.

128
00:08:10.549 --> 00:08:13.850
But she was also admitted in the same room...

129
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:15.219
as the other eight victims.

130
00:08:15.219 --> 00:08:17.620
So she wasn't on the list of suspects because she was a patient?

131
00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:20.489
You're right. When the victims were all killed,

132
00:08:20.489 --> 00:08:22.930
Ha Ju Won was also ill.

133
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.629
And so she was classified as one of the victims.

134
00:08:24.969 --> 00:08:27.770
Why would a patient kill the other patients?

135
00:08:28.969 --> 00:08:31.000
Because it's so unfair.

136
00:08:33.839 --> 00:08:36.910
I had to remove my intestines and stomach.

137
00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:39.310
I had so many operations done...

138
00:08:39.509 --> 00:08:41.419
for so many years, but I didn't get better.

139
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.750
But everyone else got better.

140
00:08:44.219 --> 00:08:46.120
Some even left in a few days.

141
00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:49.120
Then they told me...

142
00:08:49.689 --> 00:08:53.859
I'm so sorry for the young woman.

143
00:08:55.129 --> 00:08:57.430
You'll get better soon. Cheer up.

144
00:09:00.299 --> 00:09:02.169
They were saying all sorts of nonsense.

145
00:09:02.939 --> 00:09:05.109
So you killed all of them?

146
00:09:05.169 --> 00:09:07.310
Do you think your reason can justify what you did?

147
00:09:07.339 --> 00:09:08.509
No, it can't.

148
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:10.939
I was on my deathbed.

149
00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:14.210
I gave up everything.

150
00:09:15.319 --> 00:09:16.649
"If I get caught, then I'll just get caught."

151
00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.089
"If they punish me, let them punish me."

152
00:09:20.319 --> 00:09:21.719
I've been thinking like that.

153
00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:27.359
But...

154
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.230
the prosecutor caught someone else.

155
00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.299
Are you saying it was me?

156
00:09:38.469 --> 00:09:39.609
Then I thought,

157
00:09:40.609 --> 00:09:41.810
for the first time in my life,

158
00:09:43.279 --> 00:09:45.250
I have something called hope.

159
00:09:45.879 --> 00:09:49.750
The one who gave me hope is you, Lee Yu Beom.

160
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:52.520
And I hope...

161
00:09:54.219 --> 00:09:55.219
that you...

162
00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.529
will remain my only hope until the end.

163
00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:04.430
So have you put Ha Ju Won on the wanted list?

164
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:07.100
Yes, but she hasn't come home for a very long time.

165
00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:10.969
It's quite hard to trace her because she's using burner phones.

166
00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:15.810
All her records of credit cards and bus cards are gone after the arson.

167
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:17.609
It means she'll run away until the end.

168
00:10:18.649 --> 00:10:21.719
She can only run away for a few days these days.

169
00:10:21.819 --> 00:10:26.319
She was on the run for over a year.

170
00:10:30.989 --> 00:10:34.089
She'd think it'll work this time as well.

171
00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:39.129
So Lawyer Lee, make another miracle happen.

172
00:10:39.529 --> 00:10:42.899
Give me hope, will you?

173
00:10:44.299 --> 00:10:45.640
I can't listen to you anymore.

174
00:10:49.379 --> 00:10:53.009
When did I become hope to trash like you?

175
00:10:53.149 --> 00:10:54.450
Why am I trash?

176
00:10:54.609 --> 00:10:56.549
Because you killed people!

177
00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.549
What can I do now?

178
00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.919
It already happened.

179
00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:07.890
Yes.

180
00:11:09.629 --> 00:11:11.100
It's sad.

181
00:11:12.569 --> 00:11:14.529
But whoever is alive must go on.

182
00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:18.469
Who would benefit from finding out I was the real culprit?

183
00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.040
To the family of the victims, Myung Yi Suk's a piece of trash,

184
00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.210
and that piece of trash died.

185
00:11:23.279 --> 00:11:26.609
That would have been a comfort, but what if I suddenly appear?

186
00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.180
It will break their hearts.

187
00:11:30.419 --> 00:11:32.290
And what about Myung Yi Suk's son?

188
00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:34.960
He'll go mad if he finds out his dad was innocent.

189
00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:36.890
And you...

190
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.500
What will you do then?

191
00:11:43.759 --> 00:11:44.770
Shut your mouth.

192
00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:49.640
I was very shocked to hear the news...

193
00:11:49.939 --> 00:11:52.710
that bottles of medication were found in Myung Yi Suk's office.

194
00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.540
32 bottles of...

195
00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:58.980
It must have made you anxious.

196
00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:01.549
It was so obvious that Myung Yi Suk was the criminal.

197
00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.419
No direct evidence was found.

198
00:12:03.779 --> 00:12:06.020
The media kept questioning the prosecutors' competence.

199
00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.319
And you manipulated the confiscated bottles as Myung Yi Suk's.

200
00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.560
Is that right? Am I right?

201
00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:13.160
The bottles were already in there.

202
00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.129
Then why would you call me a killer?

203
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.230
If the bottles were found there, Myung Yi Suk is the murderer.

204
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:19.370
Why would you call me trash?

205
00:12:21.669 --> 00:12:22.669
Tell me.

206
00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.239
Now you get it, right?

207
00:12:26.609 --> 00:12:27.810
If anything goes wrong with me,

208
00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.140
same goes for you too.

209
00:12:37.319 --> 00:12:38.390
But don't worry.

210
00:12:39.589 --> 00:12:41.719
The people who know that this was manipulated...

211
00:12:42.989 --> 00:12:46.060
are just you and me.

212
00:12:47.689 --> 00:12:51.200
There were 3 of us, but I got rid of him.

213
00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.200
"Got rid of"?

214
00:12:57.169 --> 00:13:00.439
You saw the news on the container arson, right?

215
00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:02.279
You did that?

216
00:13:02.379 --> 00:13:05.080
Someone who knew our story was living there.

217
00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:09.350
He was taciturn.

218
00:13:10.379 --> 00:13:12.149
But he unluckily got involved with the police.

219
00:13:14.759 --> 00:13:17.319
You were here?

220
00:13:19.029 --> 00:13:22.100
Yes. The door was open.

221
00:13:22.629 --> 00:13:24.129
Aren't you overdoing it with the gloves?

222
00:13:25.799 --> 00:13:28.870
Being hot is better than being in a danger.

223
00:13:29.399 --> 00:13:32.770
I took care of your cellphone.

224
00:13:33.109 --> 00:13:34.609
I threw it in Han River.

225
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:37.739
I haven't said anything to the police.

226
00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:41.450
Young Pyo.

227
00:13:46.719 --> 00:13:47.719
Thank you.

228
00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:59.069
I took care of all the dirty deeds.

229
00:14:00.299 --> 00:14:02.500
You take care of it from now on.

230
00:14:03.399 --> 00:14:08.180
The bereaved, Myung Yi Suk's son, you, and me.

231
00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.310
Let us all be in peace.

232
00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:20.719
You know the meaning of conceal, right?

<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

234
00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:03.960
Now you know it. If something goes wrong with me,

235
00:15:04.629 --> 00:15:06.299
the same goes for you too.

236
00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:10.700
I heard the actual criminal is not Myung Yi Suk.

237
00:15:11.439 --> 00:15:14.910
But don't worry. The only people who know it was manipulated...

238
00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:17.680
are you and me.

239
00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:21.009
Our reporting department has made a new task force on Myung Yi Suk's.

240
00:15:21.009 --> 00:15:23.080
You know the meaning of conceal, right?

241
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:26.250
I have to find a way out of this.

242
00:15:43.569 --> 00:15:48.779
(Notice on electricity checkup: Power will be out on June 28.)

243
00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:07.230
You think too long.

244
00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:10.460
What now?

245
00:16:11.629 --> 00:16:13.200
Will you take me as your client?

246
00:16:14.399 --> 00:16:15.439
Before that,

247
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:18.509
you missed one thing.

248
00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:21.169
What is it?

249
00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:23.410
We aren't the only two people who know about the manipulation.

250
00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:25.410
There are three of us.

251
00:16:27.109 --> 00:16:28.149
Who is it?

252
00:16:30.279 --> 00:16:31.549
Mr. Choi, what do you want?

253
00:16:33.089 --> 00:16:36.319
Hyang Mi, you're the only one who truly thinks about me.

254
00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:37.520
A good girl indeed.

255
00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:39.560
Give me the meat.

256
00:16:41.029 --> 00:16:44.160
I know, right? I'm so pretty and kind.

257
00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:46.799
Can't I have someone like Lieutenant Han as a prize?

258
00:16:47.129 --> 00:16:49.899
Don't say like that. To him, that's a punishment.

259
00:16:50.339 --> 00:16:51.339
Give me that.

260
00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:54.540
Give me.

261
00:16:55.439 --> 00:16:58.480
So Prosecutor Lee and Prosecutor Jung both think that...

262
00:16:58.509 --> 00:17:01.580
the IV drip serial murder case was manipulated?

263
00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:02.620
Yes.

264
00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:07.189
The case was investigated by Lawyer Lee and Mr. Choi.

265
00:17:07.649 --> 00:17:09.520
So the two of them manipulated?

266
00:17:09.989 --> 00:17:12.290
- No... - That's what Prosecutor Lee thinks.

267
00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:16.359
But Prosecutor Jung keeps denying that Mr. Choi would have done it.

268
00:17:16.399 --> 00:17:19.529
Over 10 people died. If it was manipulated,

269
00:17:19.899 --> 00:17:21.469
so many will get hurt.

270
00:17:21.469 --> 00:17:24.839
That's why Prosecutor Jung is more desperate for this case.

271
00:17:24.939 --> 00:17:26.169
To protect Mr. Choi.

272
00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:09.850
You have an interview?

273
00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:14.649
Yes, I have an interview with the victims' families of serial murder.

274
00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:20.589
You said you'll write fairly. Am I right?

275
00:18:20.629 --> 00:18:23.730
I request for an interview at 8pm in my office.

276
00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.469
So many interviews for me.

277
00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:28.799
Lawyer Lee wants an interview.

278
00:18:29.169 --> 00:18:32.439
He was the prosecutor for the IV drip serial murder case, right?

279
00:18:32.439 --> 00:18:33.439
Yes.

280
00:18:33.469 --> 00:18:35.310
If there's a real criminal somewhere else,

281
00:18:35.739 --> 00:18:38.649
it means the investigation had some blind spots.

282
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:41.049
- Go dig it out. - Yes, sir.

283
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:50.489
Will it rain today?

284
00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:54.029
No, there's only five percent of rain probability.

285
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:56.799
Okay, I'll be right back.

286
00:18:57.859 --> 00:19:01.640
Prosecutor Lee, copies of Mr. Choi's personnel record are here.

287
00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:05.509
Why did you do that?

288
00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:09.339
Where is Prosecutor Lee?

289
00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:11.810
Did Prosecutor Lee ask you to photocopy these?

290
00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:12.850
Yes.

291
00:19:13.009 --> 00:19:15.080
He's being too harsh.

292
00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:18.049
Can he find out if he manipulated looking at these records?

293
00:19:20.489 --> 00:19:23.089
What? What? What's wrong?

294
00:19:23.219 --> 00:19:26.259
I can look into it, can't I?

295
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.029
Mr. Choi was a policeman before?

296
00:19:30.029 --> 00:19:32.899
Yes, that's why he's good at crime scenes.

297
00:19:33.399 --> 00:19:34.629
Ill Yoo Police Station...

298
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.270
Why? Do you know the place?

299
00:19:37.439 --> 00:19:39.140
My father used to work there.

300
00:19:39.569 --> 00:19:40.969
They worked at the same time?

301
00:19:41.239 --> 00:19:42.379
Yes, it is.

302
00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:45.480
What a coincidence.

303
00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:50.049
It can't be...

304
00:19:56.589 --> 00:19:57.589
Mr. Choi!

305
00:20:00.029 --> 00:20:02.529
He's not here. He resigned.

306
00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:04.299
What are you talking about? He resigned?

307
00:20:04.299 --> 00:20:06.399
When I came back from lunch,

308
00:20:06.399 --> 00:20:08.339
he turned in his resignation.

309
00:20:08.739 --> 00:20:12.239
I stopped him and asked if he won't say goodbye to Prosecutor Jung.

310
00:20:12.239 --> 00:20:16.109
He said it will be hard seeing your face. He wrote a letter and left.

311
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:29.989
Dear Prosecutor Jung. I did not manipulate anything.

312
00:20:30.719 --> 00:20:33.930
Lawyer Lee will say the same thing.

313
00:20:34.899 --> 00:20:36.830
It's obvious that the two of us will deny the manipulation.

314
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:40.399
What we both plead doesn't mean anything.

315
00:20:40.669 --> 00:20:44.700
So don't bother thinking for me or others.

316
00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:47.210
Reinvestigate this case fairly.

317
00:20:48.339 --> 00:20:51.080
I'll prove my innocence my way.

318
00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:54.350
Thank you for everything.

319

(From Choi Dam Dong)

320
00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:04.020
He's so harsh quitting like this.

321
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:06.259
What shall we do?

322
00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:12.270
(Prosecutor Jung Jae Chan)

323
00:21:17.069 --> 00:21:18.109
Is it Jae Chan?

324
00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:19.939
He's calling for the investigation.

325
00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.379
Is he bothering you over the IV drip case?

326
00:21:25.509 --> 00:21:27.810
I'm being suspected.

327
00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:31.149
It will be hard for you to work on your own when it gets serious.

328
00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:34.290
My law firm will help you.

329
00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:36.660
It's reassuring.

330
00:21:39.129 --> 00:21:40.960
Hyang Mi, don't mention about his resignation to anybody.

331
00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.600
Mr. Choi did not quit. You understand?

332
00:21:42.759 --> 00:21:44.200
He's still not picking up the phone.

333
00:21:46.899 --> 00:21:48.700
I think I will go to his place.

334
00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:51.569
Yes, call me when you meet him. Don't let him go anywhere.

335
00:21:51.839 --> 00:21:52.839
Yes, sir.

336
00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.410
(Mr. Choi, I'll be waiting for you at the office.)

337
00:22:06.589 --> 00:22:07.890
Thank you for the meal today.

338
00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:09.520
Take good care of yourself.

339
00:22:11.259 --> 00:22:13.029
I have to go now. Call me next time.

340
00:22:22.439 --> 00:22:25.140
(Prosecutor Jung: Please call me.)

341
00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:46.460
(Nam Hong Joo)

342
00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.399
Hello, Hong Joo. I'm in my office.

343
00:22:55.469 --> 00:22:57.640
I told the front desk about your visit. You can just come up.

344
00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:25.430
(Notice: Electricity checkup)

345
00:23:31.739 --> 00:23:32.910
You're here.

346
00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:35.009
Yes, what are you doing?

347
00:23:35.509 --> 00:23:37.410
I'm working on the investigation for the IV drip case.

348
00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:39.480
It's hard to remember a case from last year,

349
00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.580
so I'm trying to write up a file in hopes that I can organize my thoughts.

350
00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:43.419
Please sit, and wait.

351
00:23:43.919 --> 00:23:44.950
Sure.

352
00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.319
Will you give me that data?

353
00:23:48.319 --> 00:23:50.790
Of course, I'm making it for you.

354
00:23:54.089 --> 00:23:55.129
Press release?

355
00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.500
Are you sharing it with other places too?

356
00:24:04.069 --> 00:24:07.169
No, you're the first to get it.

357
00:24:08.879 --> 00:24:11.279
I haven't called the others yet.

358
00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:13.580
Just because you're giving me an exclusive,

359
00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:15.520
I can't promise I'll be kind.

360
00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:20.689
Of course.

361
00:24:46.049 --> 00:24:50.279
Today's the electricity checkup. All power will be out shortly.

362
00:24:50.279 --> 00:24:53.350
I have an appointment with Lawyer Lee.

363
00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:56.520
I'll make it short. We'll talk very briefly.

364
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000
No!

365
00:25:10.169 --> 00:25:13.169
After I administer this, you won't be able to breathe.

366
00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:17.710
Then in five minutes, you'll die as though you're falling asleep.

367
00:25:18.109 --> 00:25:20.710
Jae Chan. Did you hear me?

368
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:22.350
Please.

369
00:25:34.859 --> 00:25:38.730
Hong Joo. Pick up the phone. Please!

370
00:25:39.299 --> 00:25:41.669
(Youngdeok Crab)

371
00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:53.879
The third one who knows about it besides us...

372
00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:56.379
is her?

373
00:25:58.049 --> 00:25:59.089
Yes.

374
00:26:16.739 --> 00:26:17.839
(Little Pup)

375
00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:29.149
- Hello? - I just dreamt that...

376
00:26:29.149 --> 00:26:30.379
Hong Joo got abducted.

377
00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.219
- Abducted? - Abducted?

378
00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:33.790
What are you saying? Who is it?

379
00:26:34.089 --> 00:26:36.589
That dream. A rainy day and a green umbrella.

380
00:26:36.589 --> 00:26:37.620
When is it?

381
00:26:38.529 --> 00:26:39.930
10:30pm, 15 minutes later.

382
00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:41.259
Where is the place?

383
00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:43.730
- You said some mountains, right? - It's not the mountains.

384
00:26:45.069 --> 00:26:46.899
It's the rooftop of Hae Kwang Law Firm.

385
00:28:13.589 --> 00:28:15.484
