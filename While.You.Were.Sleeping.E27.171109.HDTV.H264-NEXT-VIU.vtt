00:00:06.679 --> 00:00:09.450
(Episode 27)

2
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:14.550
Are you okay?

3
00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:16.559
Yes, we are okay.

4
00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:18.359
The ambulance will be here in a minute.

5
00:00:20.959 --> 00:00:23.300
Are you okay? Your hand looks like it got hurt.

6
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.470
- Is that what's important now? - Goodness.

7
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.470
Why did you come to a place like this by yourself?

8
00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.999
Why didn't you call me?

9
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.639
I felt sorry for calling you after working hours.

10
00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:36.210
You should've called me even if you felt sorry!

11
00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:39.749
What would've happened if you were alone and got hurt...

12
00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:41.579
because you ignored procedure and formalities?

13
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.049
What did I say when you executed the warrant?

14
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.850
What is the most important thing in times like this?

15
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.290
- My safety. - You know it so well!

16
00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:52.689
But why would you come here alone?

17
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.529
If I hadn't come here today,

18
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.870
you could have been killed.

19
00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:07.469
Jae Chan did not have any idea that this place was dangerous.

20
00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:08.510
Stay out of this!

21
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.809
Taking his side doesn't help him.

22
00:01:10.809 --> 00:01:11.980
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.180
Even for you too, Hong Joo.

24
00:01:17.419 --> 00:01:21.450
Why would you come here at night when you don't know who's out there?

25
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:22.960
He's right. You're not scared at all.

26
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.900
The ambulance is here.

27
00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.669
Goodness. Whom should I follow in situations like this?

28
00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:38.500
I have only one body.

29
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.709
Please go with him.

30
00:01:40.769 --> 00:01:43.339
He inhaled a lot of gas trying to rescue me.

31
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.609
No, sir. Please go with Hong Joo.

32
00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:46.910
Her hand was shaking badly.

33
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.780
No, my hands are not shaking. They're fine now.

34
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.220
Jae Chan must have internal injury that's worse than mine.

35
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.790
Hong Joo, you're not fine.

36
00:01:53.019 --> 00:01:54.619
No, I'm fine.

37
00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:55.690
It's you who is not fine.

38
00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.060
Are you okay?

39
00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:00.929
Goodness, those love birds.

40
00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:02.130
And you're hurt here too.

41
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.230
Here! Over here.

42
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.209
When you ignore the assistant chief prosecutor's orders...

43
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.040
and go to a site without your inspector,

44
00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:19.980
you can become the victim.

45
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.750
You're destroying the neutrality of the whole investigation.

46
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.480
Do you understand?

47
00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:26.690
Yes, sir.

48
00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:33.359
Sir, by the way, how did you know I was here?

49
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.200
That's not important now.

50
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.230
Be quiet, and just wear the oxygen mask.

51
00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:45.169
Not only does this provide oxygen, it also prevents you from talking.

52
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.239
What a relief. What a relief...

53
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.280
What a relief. You're alive...

54
00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:16.369
Thank you, sir.

55
00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.880
Please listen to me now if you feel thankful.

56
00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:23.839
Don't make me worry about you anymore.

57
00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:00.550
Hong Joo, we'll go over to your place for breakfast soon.

58
00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:03.250
I know. I just have a favor to ask.

59
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.750
A favor? What is it?

60
00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.889
I inhaled so much smoke last night.

61
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.729
I keep blowing my nose, but ash keeps coming out.

62
00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.029
I can even use my snot to write...

63
00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:30.079
Jae Chan...

64
00:04:30.079 --> 00:04:33.779
Hong Joo is here to ask you a favor.

65
00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:34.950
Is she?

66
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:37.979
Wait a moment.

67
00:04:45.329 --> 00:04:46.829
Write with my snot.

68
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.959
Can I make up for what I've said?

69
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.170
Goodness. It's disgusting.

70
00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:59.610
He snores like a trumpet. I don't need an alarm.

71
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.310
I wake up to his snoring every morning.

72
00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.610
I hope you're not shocked.

73
00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:10.880
You said you always see his gross side in your dreams anyway.

74
00:05:11.079 --> 00:05:14.349
Yes, it's fine. I have ash coming out of my nose too.

75
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.519
Your brother is much sexier when he's moisturized from shower.

76
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.829
Whatever he does makes my heart flutter.

77
00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:26.800
You're love blinded to a serious level.

78
00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.240
Goodness, Seung Won. Wash up now. You'll be late.

79
00:05:38.079 --> 00:05:39.110
What's the favor you were going to ask?

80
00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:45.950
I just roughly explained about last night's accident to my mom.

81
00:05:46.019 --> 00:05:47.349
I didn't want her to worry too much.

82
00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:48.490
What did you tell her?

83
00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.930
I just said I called up 911 when I saw fire as I walked by.

84
00:05:53.459 --> 00:05:55.430
So don't say anything during breakfast.

85
00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:56.800
Sure, I'll do that.

86
00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.399
Shall can we go now?

87
00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:04.539
Don't do that to me.

88
00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:07.409
- What? - Don't say you're okay...

89
00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:08.839
when you're not.

90
00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:13.349
Bad things, bad dreams. You have to tell me everything.

91
00:06:13.709 --> 00:06:14.750
Don't lie to me.

92
00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:17.519
Okay.

93
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.889
Do you still have that dream you told me about?

94
00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:21.750
The dream about the rainy day and green umbrella.

95
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.589
No, I don't. I haven't had that dream for a while now.

96
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.729
It's true, right? You aren't lying, right?

97
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.000
It's true.

98
00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:37.599
If I have that dream again, you'll be the first to know. Don't worry.

99
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:40.539
All right, then.

100
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.450
(Parking for assigned vehicles only)

101
00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.029
So inside the mobile phone...

102
00:06:59.029 --> 00:07:01.589
were photos of victims of the IV drip serial murder case,

103
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.000
- right? - Yes, sir.

104
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.529
Is he related to Myung Yi Suk?

105
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.070
Like an accomplice?

106
00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.969
Maybe. I'll get to know more when I cover it closely.

107
00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:12.209
He could be the real criminal.

108
00:07:12.209 --> 00:07:14.839
A real criminal? With what basis are you saying this?

109
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.380
Other than the 11 photos of victims, there were extra 8 photos...

110
00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:19.680
in his mobile phone.

111
00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:23.579
What are you saying? What happened to the 8 people?

112
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:24.979
They're all dead.

113
00:07:25.079 --> 00:07:26.089
- What? - Sorry?

114
00:07:27.089 --> 00:07:30.459
Why were the eight victims not listed in that case?

115
00:07:30.459 --> 00:07:32.630
They were not from the same hospital room with the case.

116
00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.930
They weren't counted because they died after Myung Yi Suk's arrest.

117
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:37.800
They died after he got arrested?

118
00:07:38.969 --> 00:07:41.969
Then he could be the real criminal or an accomplice.

119
00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.269
This means a serial killer is still alive out there in the world.

120
00:07:45.269 --> 00:07:47.039
There's also a threat that he might commit another crime.

121
00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:48.810
Are you sure...

122
00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:51.339
that the man who died in the fire wasn't the serial killer?

123
00:07:51.339 --> 00:07:53.649
The person who died from the fire wasn't the owner of the cellphone.

124
00:07:53.649 --> 00:07:55.779
He was just a person receiving the phone for someone else.

125
00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.479
When the police approached the person who was looking for the phone,

126
00:07:58.619 --> 00:07:59.849
somebody else killed him with fire?

127
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:02.060
There's a high possibility that the phone belongs to the arsonist.

128
00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.959
And it's highly likely for him to be the serial killer.

129
00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:08.259
Calm down, everyone. We can't make any assumptions.

130
00:08:08.329 --> 00:08:10.599
This is a reinvestigation, so let's be cautious.

131
00:08:12.369 --> 00:08:14.829
Did you get the personal information of the cellphone owner?

132
00:08:14.829 --> 00:08:17.839
It's not easy to find the owner because it's a burner phone.

133
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:18.940
Hong Joo.

134
00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.310
Weren't you in charge of this case last year?

135
00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:23.810
I was, sir.

136
00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:27.109
I want you two to take yourselves off the line and focus on this case.

137
00:08:27.109 --> 00:08:30.550
Du Hyun, go to the hospital, and find out about the eight patients.

138
00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.520
Hong Joo, stick with the police and prosecution to find out...

139
00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.749
about the owner of the phone.

140
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:37.119
Figure out if there were any problems with the old investigation.

141
00:08:37.259 --> 00:08:38.589
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

142
00:08:41.329 --> 00:08:44.629
Did you give the phone's back up data to the digital forensic team?

143
00:08:44.629 --> 00:08:46.270
Yes, I did.

144
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.969
By the way, how do you know about this case so well, Jae Chan?

145
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:51.910
It's not your case.

146
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:54.009
Well... I was the first to recognize this as a case.

147
00:08:54.009 --> 00:08:56.180
You are the victim of the arson case.

148
00:08:56.579 --> 00:08:58.180
How can a victim investigate?

149
00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:01.109
You'll be excluded if I were the judge.

150
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:02.550
I know, sir.

151
00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:04.780
Don't deal with this case, Jae Chan.

152
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.849
Ms. Son and Ms. Shin should lead this case.

153
00:09:07.849 --> 00:09:08.859
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

154
00:09:08.859 --> 00:09:12.859
You and Prosecutor Lee should work on reinvestigating...

155
00:09:12.959 --> 00:09:14.229
the IV drip serial murder case.

156
00:09:15.259 --> 00:09:16.259
Yes, sir.

157
00:09:16.729 --> 00:09:17.930
- Yes, sir. - If you...

158
00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:20.770
do not follow my command and run out to the crime scene again,

159
00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.599
I'll remove you from the team.

160
00:09:22.739 --> 00:09:23.770
Yes, sir.

161
00:09:24.369 --> 00:09:27.869
Well, we have 2 cases, but there is only 1 suspect.

162
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:29.680
We'll work on it with two tracks.

163
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.450
Both teams should have a meeting every day and cooperate.

164
00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:39.719
I'll contact the Yeonju office to get records of the case...

165
00:09:39.719 --> 00:09:41.390
and request to investigate on the confiscated goods.

166
00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:42.459
Okay.

167
00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:44.890
Jae Chan.

168
00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:49.300
Will you be okay?

169
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.369
- What do you mean? - Reinvestigating a finished case...

170
00:09:52.369 --> 00:09:54.930
means something in the previous investigation had gone wrong.

171
00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:55.969
Yes, I'm aware of that.

172
00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.670
You have to investigate Lawyer Lee who was the prosecutor for this.

173
00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:03.140
You also have to investigate Mr. Choi, who was the inspector.

174
00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.009
I'm sure that nothing went wrong,

175
00:10:06.349 --> 00:10:08.550
but if we find a problem with the previous investigation,

176
00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.320
Mr. Choi may face disciplinary action.

177
00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:14.989
Best case, dereliction of duty.

178
00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.290
In the worst case, he might have to go through a trial.

179
00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:21.959
I couldn't do this alone because it's my right hand.

180
00:10:22.859 --> 00:10:23.859
Thank you.

181
00:10:24.329 --> 00:10:26.469
- I'm such a good girl, right? - Yes.

182
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.499
I'm such a good girl.

183
00:10:28.499 --> 00:10:32.109
How I wish I can meet a guy like Lieutenant Han.

184
00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:34.570
Lieutenant Han has lived his life as a good person too.

185
00:10:39.749 --> 00:10:41.379
I'm sorry, okay?

186
00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.180
Mr. Choi might be in trouble.

187
00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:47.089
Do you think you can reinvestigate on this case?

188
00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:52.060
You were good.

189
00:11:02.869 --> 00:11:06.839
(Episode 27: Catch Me if You Can)

190
00:11:15.749 --> 00:11:18.249
Goodness. There are so many records for this case.

191
00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.320
We'll have to pull a few all-nighters to go through it all.

192
00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.890
11 people died. Of course there are many records.

193
00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:25.930
Sir, please shut it softly!

194
00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:28.800
Why would you shut it so hard when you can just press a button?

195
00:11:29.129 --> 00:11:30.999
Jae Chan, I've been watching you.

196
00:11:30.999 --> 00:11:33.129
Don't leave any scratches on the leather seats when you put them.

197
00:11:33.129 --> 00:11:34.400
The color...

198
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.770
I should have requested for a separate car for this.

199
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:39.239
Sir, get in the car.

200
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:40.770
You get in too. We'll be late.

201
00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:47.280
Whose car is this?

202
00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.219
It seems like my car, but it seems like it isn't

203
00:11:51.219 --> 00:11:53.190
It seems like it's my car.

204
00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:54.820
What is he saying?

205
00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:01.859
I wish I was in the same team with you on the arson case.

206
00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:03.060
I miss you.

207
00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:07.469
Let's all put the confiscated goods and the trial record in your office.

208
00:12:07.599 --> 00:12:09.499
I'll keep the investigation records in my office.

209
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:12.910
You can't do that. Mr. Choi works in your office.

210
00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:14.410
Put it all in my office.

211
00:12:14.869 --> 00:12:16.979
You're leaving Mr. Choi out of this reinvestigation?

212
00:12:16.979 --> 00:12:20.209
Of course. Send him to the arson case team.

213
00:12:20.209 --> 00:12:21.650
Let's ask for another investigator.

214
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:25.989
I'll reinvestigate this case with Mr. Choi.

215
00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:29.759
Mr. Choi has nothing to do with the people who are involved.

216
00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.430
He shouldn't be exempted just because of our assumptions.

217
00:12:33.129 --> 00:12:34.930
Gosh, this guy...

218
00:12:38.229 --> 00:12:40.900
I said to put all the records in my office!

219
00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.099
Please!

220
00:12:42.099 --> 00:12:46.469
Mr. Choi investigated this case with Lee Yu Beom.

221
00:12:46.469 --> 00:12:49.780
If any false records are found, he could turn out to be a criminal.

222
00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:55.349
Let's talk about this later.

223
00:12:55.349 --> 00:12:57.979
What do you mean later? What if he wanted the honor...

224
00:12:57.979 --> 00:12:59.849
- and manipulated the case? - Mr. Lee!

225
00:12:59.849 --> 00:13:01.249
What? Why? What did I say wrongly?

226
00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.459
I don't want to suspect Mr. Choi of wrongdoing either.

227
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.959
But what can I do? My job as a prosecutor is to suspect everything.

228
00:13:06.459 --> 00:13:10.300
Our job is to suspect even those who we don't want to suspect.

229
00:13:12.599 --> 00:13:13.829
He's right.

230
00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:15.969
I know, right? Mr. Choi!

231
00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:19.869
I mean...

232
00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:23.379
I'm not saying that you made a mistake during the investigation.

233
00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:24.410
I know.

234
00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.550
I should be left out on this case.

235
00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.749
These records should be put in the Prosecutor Lee's office.

236
00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:41.859
What? What? He said that I'm right too.

237
00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:01.009
Prosecutor Lee is being too much.

238
00:14:01.009 --> 00:14:04.320
How can he do that to his partner?

239
00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.249
- He's such a cold-hearted man. - I know, right?

240
00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:10.089
It could have hurt his feelings, but it's an investigation.

241
00:14:10.089 --> 00:14:11.930
What? You're taking Prosecutor Lee's side now?

242
00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:14.890
She's not taking any side. She's just saying it can happen.

243
00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:17.200
It's possible that a real criminal could be found somewhere.

244
00:14:17.229 --> 00:14:19.930
That means the old investigation had gone wrong and Mr. Choi...

245
00:14:22.869 --> 00:14:26.670
I know Mr. Choi better than anyone. He would never...

246
00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:27.739
He would never do such thing.

247
00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:36.249
How can you be so sure?

248
00:14:39.749 --> 00:14:41.989
You said the same thing to me about Do Hak Young's case.

249
00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:43.790
Do you think this is the same case?

250
00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:45.160
It's not that different.

251
00:14:46.259 --> 00:14:49.599
I think what you said to me then is the correct answer.

252
00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.200
I know Mr. Choi is a nice person.

253
00:14:58.469 --> 00:15:00.440
It's true there are many suspicious things about the case too.

254
00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:02.640
Let's talk about this later when we get out.

255
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.950
I don't want to hear it here as it'll make me lose my appetite.

256
00:15:17.759 --> 00:15:21.829
Did Mr. Choi explain how he knew about the arson and came?

257
00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:24.200
No, but there are many ways to know about the case.

258
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.229
Like how?

259
00:15:25.229 --> 00:15:26.499
He could have followed me.

260
00:15:26.499 --> 00:15:28.030
He would have stopped you before the arson if he followed you.

261
00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:30.540
Or he could have been walking past by coincidence...

262
00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:33.469
It was a place that was far from his regular path.

263
00:15:33.469 --> 00:15:36.079
He could have seen the fire from the distance and ran to me.

264
00:15:36.079 --> 00:15:37.410
He came before the fire started.

265
00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:46.920
Do you remember what Mr. Choi said to me that night?

266
00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:49.219
You too, Hong Joo.

267
00:15:49.219 --> 00:15:53.160
How could you come here without knowing who's out there at night?

268
00:15:53.329 --> 00:15:55.400
He knew we went there separately.

269
00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.430
He came there before the arson.

270
00:15:58.729 --> 00:16:00.900
Why would he wait for the fire to rescue you?

271
00:16:01.869 --> 00:16:02.900
Isn't it strange?

272
00:16:03.339 --> 00:16:05.099
So what are you trying to say?

273
00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:07.869
Are you trying to say Mr. Choi is an accomplice with the arsonist?

274
00:16:07.869 --> 00:16:09.339
It's not what we mean.

275
00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.209
Don't get suspicious, and just ask him.

276
00:16:11.209 --> 00:16:13.349
Mr. Choi risked his life to save us.

277
00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:15.520
How could you ask him, "How did you know I was here"?

278
00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.280
Is it right to ask him "Why did you wait for the fire to save us"?

279
00:16:17.749 --> 00:16:18.989
But you still have to ask him.

280
00:16:19.249 --> 00:16:21.390
You can't just assume because you don't want to be rude and ask.

281
00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:22.959
That is even worse.

282
00:16:36.983 --> 00:16:40.215
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E27 While You Were Sleeping "Catch Me If You Can"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

283
00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:51.950
Are you mad?

284
00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:56.390
What Woo Tak said was...

285
00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:57.719
I know.

286
00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.160
I know he's right, and I'm wrong.

287
00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:02.400
I changed my words.

288
00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:04.100
I know I was not being a good prosecutor.

289
00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:08.600
I know why you and Woo Tak would doubt Mr. Choi too.

290
00:17:11.799 --> 00:17:13.209
I know it in my head,

291
00:17:15.509 --> 00:17:16.610
but my heart can't believe it.

292
00:17:21.279 --> 00:17:23.350
I hate myself so much now. I'm so disgraceful.

293
00:17:23.979 --> 00:17:25.950
I'm embarrassed that you had to see this side of me.

294
00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:31.120
Did we just fight?

295
00:17:34.729 --> 00:17:35.759
Do you want to be alone?

296
00:17:40.729 --> 00:17:44.370
Okay then. I think it's better off that I go alone today.

297
00:17:47.739 --> 00:17:48.779
I'll take off first.

298
00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:07.660
I said I want to go to work alone.

299
00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:11.860
Me too. Let us go to work alone together.

300
00:18:14.269 --> 00:18:16.440
That's nonsense.

301
00:18:30.219 --> 00:18:32.150
Where is the sentencing on Myung Yi Suk?

302
00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:34.690
It's here.

303
00:18:35.319 --> 00:18:36.319
Hey.

304
00:18:37.219 --> 00:18:38.219
You're here.

305
00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:41.130
- Where is Mr. Choi? - He's in the arson team now.

306
00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:44.299
- Sorry? - I'll go through the confiscations.

307
00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:47.900
Why are you telling me?

308
00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:50.400
He's throwing a tantrum towards me.

309
00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:51.940
Just ignore him.

310
00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:56.940
I don't think that Mr. Choi would manipulate a case...

311
00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:59.709
just to get promoted at work.

312
00:18:59.749 --> 00:19:00.749
Okay.

313
00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:07.819
Prosecutor Lee, Ms. Son wants you in the video investigation room.

314
00:19:07.819 --> 00:19:10.620
- Me? Why? - She's lining up arson suspects,

315
00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:11.860
and she needs a sidekick.

316
00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:14.430
- What are they calling me for? - I have to go.

317
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:16.200
- I haven't done anything. - Why am I here?

318
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.630
Chins up so we can see your faces.

319
00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:24.600
- Witness? - Yes, sir.

320
00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.509
Someone saw a man running away on a bicycle from the scene.

321
00:19:27.509 --> 00:19:30.779
I called up whoever spoke to Jo Yoon Pyo that day...

322
00:19:30.809 --> 00:19:34.249
and has similar foot sizes of the footprints from the scene.

323
00:19:34.479 --> 00:19:36.680
It's him.

324
00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.049
The guy on the far right. The guy with a lot of teeth.

325
00:19:40.019 --> 00:19:43.160
I am sure. I saw those teeth last night.

326
00:19:43.489 --> 00:19:45.229
The teeth glowed from the dark.

327
00:19:45.259 --> 00:19:48.860
You said the suspect was wearing a mask. You couldn't see any teeth!

328
00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:50.160
Did I say that?

329
00:19:50.729 --> 00:19:53.330
Oh, right. It's the second guy from the left.

330
00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:54.330
Second?

331
00:19:54.729 --> 00:19:57.039
No. Maybe the third.

332
00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.769
What a mess.

333
00:20:07.049 --> 00:20:09.950
Contrary to prior belief, it's quite hard to purchase gasoline.

334
00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:13.519
If consumers buy it from a container,

335
00:20:13.519 --> 00:20:15.989
we must record their personal information.

336
00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:19.130
Was there anyone who bought it on June 22 or earlier?

337
00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:23.930
No.

338
00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.569
How many gas stations do we have around here within 5km?

339
00:20:26.569 --> 00:20:27.769
Over 40.

340
00:20:30.569 --> 00:20:31.670
40...

341
00:20:40.979 --> 00:20:44.219
Hello, Lawyer Lee.

342
00:20:44.249 --> 00:20:47.819
It seems like you enjoy hot coffees during the summer too.

343
00:20:56.059 --> 00:20:59.600
It makes sense. The air conditioning is strong here,

344
00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:02.799
so you would want hot coffee.

345
00:21:02.799 --> 00:21:03.840
Who is this jerk?

346
00:21:17.279 --> 00:21:18.279
Welcome.

347
00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:23.420
You guys sell pain relief patches here, right?

348
00:21:24.319 --> 00:21:27.190
Yes, it's right next to the toothbrushes and toothpastes.

349
00:21:27.959 --> 00:21:28.959
Thank you.

350
00:21:34.999 --> 00:21:36.499
How do you feel now?

351
00:21:36.499 --> 00:21:38.769
Do you have anything to say to the family of 11 victims?

352
00:21:38.769 --> 00:21:40.440
Do you have anything to say to your son?

353
00:21:41.039 --> 00:21:43.880
Please say something. Please say a word to your son.

354
00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:45.580
How do you feel now?

355
00:21:46.479 --> 00:21:47.650
Please say something.

356
00:21:56.959 --> 00:21:57.959
How much is it?

357
00:22:01.489 --> 00:22:03.229
You're a reporter Nam Hong Joo from SBC, right?

358
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:06.670
How do you know me? Did you see me on TV?

359
00:22:07.229 --> 00:22:08.529
No, I saw you in person.

360
00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:14.170
How do you feel now?

361
00:22:16.239 --> 00:22:18.880
Do you have anything to say to the family of the 11 victims?

362
00:22:20.709 --> 00:22:22.450
Do you have anything to say to your son?

363
00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.840
I'm the son of Myung Yi Suk, the serial killer.

364
00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:56.580
You were the only one I saw among the many other reporters.

365
00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.450
You were so persistent.

366
00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:02.219
I mean... Listen.

367
00:23:02.319 --> 00:23:04.259
Do you know that my father is dead?

368
00:23:18.269 --> 00:23:21.110
She knows. She also knows that he felt he was wrongly accused.

369
00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.180
You're Myung Dae Gu, right? Seung Won's friend.

370
00:23:28.819 --> 00:23:30.620
(Prosecutor Jung Jae Chan)

371
00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:34.249
I'm reinvestigating your father's case.

372
00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.890
- Reinvestigate? - Yes.

373
00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:41.459
We're checking if anything went wrong with the prior investigation.

374
00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:43.229
I'll go through all the evidence too.

375
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:45.400
If anything unfair happened in the previous investigation,

376
00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.900
or you have any evidence that proves your father's innocence,

377
00:23:48.069 --> 00:23:50.469
call me at this number. I'll listen to everything.

378
00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.180
Thank you.

379
00:23:59.779 --> 00:24:01.009
Thank you very much.

380
00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.160
Thank you.

381
00:24:14.029 --> 00:24:15.900
Why did you buy pain relief patches? Did you get hurt?

382
00:24:19.469 --> 00:24:21.670
My mom's having muscle-ache on her shoulders.

383
00:24:23.999 --> 00:24:25.140
Are you still mad?

384
00:24:26.039 --> 00:24:29.009
Are you okay about how you felt embarrassed?

385
00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.080
Yes, maybe.

386
00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:33.850
When will you stop being mad at me?

387
00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:37.180
I'll be fine soon. Go inside now.

388
00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:51.100
Thank you.

389
00:24:52.529 --> 00:24:53.999
For what?

390
00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:58.370
I was scared of the boy at the convenience store.

391
00:24:58.469 --> 00:25:00.509
Why would you be scared of a boy? He's just a kid from high school.

392
00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:04.180
I don't know.

393
00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:09.580
I was really scared, but I got better because of someone.

394
00:25:16.719 --> 00:25:17.959
You were cool a while ago.

395
00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:21.590
You don't have to be embarrassed. Get over it.

396
00:25:21.729 --> 00:25:22.729
It's uncomfortable.

397
00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:25.900
Okay.

398
00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:33.969
I'll get over it. I'm over it. It's fine now. I'm fine.

399
00:25:40.279 --> 00:25:42.120
I'm sorry I doubted Mr. Choi.

400
00:25:42.479 --> 00:25:44.779
I didn't want to doubt him too. That's why I said to ask him.

401
00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:47.289
The assumptions get out of control if we don't ask anything.

402
00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.660
If you hear from him, you don't have to doubt him anymore.

403
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:55.559
I did all that because I really wanted to believe in Mr. Choi.

404
00:25:57.700 --> 00:25:58.700
I know.

405
00:26:20.989 --> 00:26:25.160
You have a driver? You seem like my age.

406
00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:28.330
I envy you for having a driver.

407
00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:32.370
Didn't you get all this thanks to me?

408
00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:37.940
Who is this lunatic?

409
00:26:41.239 --> 00:26:44.840
You manipulated the confiscations for Myung Yi Suk's case, right?

410
00:26:46.209 --> 00:26:47.380
You did that, right?

411
00:26:55.759 --> 00:26:56.759
Lawyer Lee.

412
00:26:57.860 --> 00:26:59.059
A guest is here for you.

413
00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:01.690
Who?

414
00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:15.309
Goodness. I was scared.

415
00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:18.209
What brought you here?

416
00:27:20.979 --> 00:27:22.880
I want to consult with you shortly.

417
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:26.219
I must count the time.

418
00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:28.620
My consulting fee is quite high.

419
00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:31.590
Three minutes will do.

420
00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:34.729
Tell me. What is it?

421
00:27:44.299 --> 00:27:45.870
(Lawyer Lee Yu Beom)

422
00:27:53.479 --> 00:27:54.809
What is it that you want to consult about?

423
00:27:55.549 --> 00:27:59.390
I know this suspect who is getting investigated by a prosecutor.

424
00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:02.789
The prosecutors keep giving out tips on the results to the media.

425
00:28:02.789 --> 00:28:05.890
They can't do that. Which prosecutor does that?

426
00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:09.400
The investigation result is strictly confidential.

427
00:28:09.759 --> 00:28:12.029
Even a suspect has his rights...

428
00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.499
and full rights to protection.

429
00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:17.900
Doesn't that suspect have his own lawyer who can stand up for him?

430
00:28:19.539 --> 00:28:22.640
Why is the prosecution leaking information about the case?

431
00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:24.009
It's obvious.

432
00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:27.779
Either they don't have enough proof, or they aren't sure about something.

433
00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:30.279
If they charge the suspect, he may get acquitted.

434
00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:31.950
So they're asking the media for help.

435
00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:36.420
Like the Cola bubble?

436
00:28:37.819 --> 00:28:38.860
Yes, something like that.

437
00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:43.559
You must have leaked the information...

438
00:28:44.259 --> 00:28:46.729
during the Myung Yi Suk case for that same reason. Am I right?

439
00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:59.479
I thought you gave it to me because you had feelings for me.

440
00:29:00.549 --> 00:29:02.019
But you had all this calculated in your head.

441
00:29:02.749 --> 00:29:06.489
You must've lacked evidence or felt unsure about something.

442
00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:13.190
Why would you...

443
00:29:14.989 --> 00:29:17.100
suddenly talk about a case that was closed a long time ago?

444
00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:20.469
I was told that the real criminal to the case is not Myung Yi Suk.

445
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:24.739
Our reporting department has made a new task force to start covering it.

446
00:29:27.309 --> 00:29:28.440
My three minutes is up.

447
00:29:30.209 --> 00:29:32.910
I'll listen to both the lawyer and the prosecutor for Myung Yi Suk's...

448
00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:36.019
case and fairly release articles. Call me if you want to add.

449
00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:39.120
I'll come whenever you call me. You know my number, right?

450
00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:44.559
- Of course, I do. - I'll get going now.

451
00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.709
- Thank you for the tea. - Good bye.

452
00:30:04.009 --> 00:30:05.009
Hello, there.

453
00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:07.509
Are you looking for someone?

454
00:30:07.779 --> 00:30:10.380
I came to give something to Lawyer Lee.

455
00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:11.779
He left this with me last time.

456
00:30:25.919 --> 00:30:30.119
(Episode 28 will air shortly.)
