00:00:10.573 --> 00:00:13.675
(of history major and civil construction major in 1999)

5
00:00:13.744 --> 00:00:15.344
Follow the arrows.

6
00:00:48.813 --> 00:00:49.953
I don't see them anymore.

7
00:00:51.853 --> 00:00:53.624
Is someone playing a prank on me?

8
00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:02.963
Hi, I'm Choi Ban Do from civil construction major.

9
00:01:02.963 --> 00:01:04.333
We met at the group blind date.

10
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:06.264
Do you want to catch a movie with me?

11
00:01:13.303 --> 00:01:16.074
Back then, we never calculated our moves.

12
00:01:16.544 --> 00:01:18.844
We just reacted to whatever our hearts told us.

13
00:01:19.283 --> 00:01:22.714
Our entire universe involved around the two of us.

14
00:01:22.854 --> 00:01:24.214
Can't I take you home?

15
00:01:24.214 --> 00:01:26.723
No way. You'll miss the last bus.

16
00:01:29.124 --> 00:01:31.253
You have to go home for today.

17
00:01:56.654 --> 00:01:57.714
Hey!

18
00:01:58.654 --> 00:01:59.854
How did you get here?

19
00:02:00.184 --> 00:02:01.953
I took a cab to give you something.

20
00:02:02.083 --> 00:02:03.253
What?

21
00:02:04.453 --> 00:02:06.193
I wanted to see you again anyway.

22
00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:09.563
Let's take a look at your excuse.

23
00:02:13.163 --> 00:02:14.603
Ban Do, are you okay?

24
00:02:16.904 --> 00:02:19.304
Goodness, you're having a reaction already.

25
00:02:19.704 --> 00:02:21.144
Why did you buy these?

26
00:02:21.174 --> 00:02:22.614
Because you like them.

27
00:02:22.774 --> 00:02:24.144
Allergy is nothing.

28
00:02:25.883 --> 00:02:28.614
You sound like you could even pick stars for me.

29
00:02:29.353 --> 00:02:30.753
If I could reach them,

30
00:02:30.753 --> 00:02:32.253
I would pick all of them for you.

31
00:02:33.223 --> 00:02:34.283
- Let's go. - Okay.

32
00:02:34.753 --> 00:02:36.353
You really are something.

33
00:02:36.353 --> 00:02:38.154
- Do you have money for a cab? - No.

34
00:02:38.154 --> 00:02:39.293
Then how will you get home?

35
00:02:39.293 --> 00:02:41.323
I'll just on home on foot.

36
00:02:41.394 --> 00:02:43.434
What happened to the time when we were willing to pick...

37
00:02:43.434 --> 00:02:44.434
the stars and moon for each other?

38
00:02:44.964 --> 00:02:46.233
Where have those times...

39
00:02:46.804 --> 00:02:48.834
and our hearts disappeared to?

40
00:02:49.774 --> 00:02:53.374
Whereabouts are we standing now?

41
00:02:55.973 --> 00:03:02.413
(Episode 9: Those Times We Had Been In Love)

42
00:03:22.063 --> 00:03:23.133
What?

43
00:03:24.103 --> 00:03:25.274
Why am I here?

44
00:03:26.844 --> 00:03:29.744
Ban Do! Wake up!

45
00:03:38.383 --> 00:03:39.483
Jin Joo.

46
00:03:45.823 --> 00:03:47.193
Hey.

47
00:03:51.533 --> 00:03:52.733
We're back.

48
00:03:54.063 --> 00:03:55.204
Aren't we?

49
00:03:57.404 --> 00:03:58.573
Where is Seo Jin?

50
00:04:01.473 --> 00:04:02.913
Won't you sober up?

51
00:04:03.543 --> 00:04:05.144
I'm not drunk.

52
00:04:06.144 --> 00:04:08.084
I had a dream about...

53
00:04:13.184 --> 00:04:14.323
Jin Joo.

54
00:04:14.684 --> 00:04:16.923
Jin Joo. Ma Jin Joo!

55
00:04:18.353 --> 00:04:20.293
Honey!

56
00:04:20.493 --> 00:04:21.564
Honey...

57
00:04:22.894 --> 00:04:23.993
Honey.

58
00:04:25.694 --> 00:04:27.504
Get up already.

59
00:04:27.634 --> 00:04:28.904
Aren't you going to school?

60
00:04:29.634 --> 00:04:31.074
My goodness.

61
00:04:45.683 --> 00:04:48.623
Mom. Take me with you to the mineral spring this weekend.

62
00:04:48.884 --> 00:04:49.993
Okay.

63
00:04:50.024 --> 00:04:51.793
- I'm going to class. - Bye.

64
00:04:59.033 --> 00:05:01.303
She's spending a lot of time with you lately.

65
00:05:01.334 --> 00:05:02.504
She's glued to your side.

66
00:05:03.074 --> 00:05:05.103
She is. I know.

67
00:05:05.103 --> 00:05:08.043
I guess it'll be crowded in the mountain this weekend.

68
00:05:08.444 --> 00:05:10.714
Why don't we take Eun Joo too?

69
00:05:11.743 --> 00:05:14.043
You aren't invited. She wants it to be just me and her.

70
00:05:14.283 --> 00:05:16.283
- Without me? - Yes.

71
00:05:16.613 --> 00:05:17.654
Why are you leaving me out?

72
00:05:17.814 --> 00:05:18.884
No.

73
00:05:18.884 --> 00:05:20.084
I'll go.

74
00:05:20.084 --> 00:05:21.783
You and I are like thread and needle.

75
00:05:21.783 --> 00:05:23.694
You aren't hers. You're mine.

76
00:05:24.053 --> 00:05:25.194
My goodness.

77
00:05:26.194 --> 00:05:28.993
- Oh, well. - Gosh.

78
00:05:30.533 --> 00:05:31.834
(Increased suicide rate among 20's after IMF)

79
00:05:31.834 --> 00:05:34.303
("Thanks Mom for giving birth to me, but life is too hard.")

80
00:05:40.204 --> 00:05:41.574
Thank you.

81
00:05:42.574 --> 00:05:44.743
Thank you for giving birth to me, Mom.

82
00:05:46.814 --> 00:05:48.384
Is she...

83
00:06:00.964 --> 00:06:02.423
(Dear Mom)

84
00:06:06.464 --> 00:06:07.564
Mom, what are you doing?

85
00:06:08.163 --> 00:06:10.204
Hey, look at this.

86
00:06:12.473 --> 00:06:13.574
She's acting weird.

87
00:06:13.574 --> 00:06:14.704
What?

88
00:06:14.873 --> 00:06:16.444
She wrote a letter for you.

89
00:06:17.644 --> 00:06:20.613
You don't think it's a suicide note, is it?

90
00:06:20.613 --> 00:06:23.783
Suicide note? Are you crazy? That's absurd.

91
00:06:23.884 --> 00:06:25.923
If it was, she wouldn't have addressed it to you.

92
00:06:25.923 --> 00:06:28.683
Your birthday is coming up. I guess it's because of that.

93
00:06:30.993 --> 00:06:32.154
My birthday?

94
00:06:32.324 --> 00:06:33.793
Mom, I'm hungry.

95
00:06:34.423 --> 00:06:36.194
I know she's your daughter,

96
00:06:36.293 --> 00:06:37.894
but you shouldn't go through her room.

97
00:06:45.004 --> 00:06:47.373
What? This is my house.

98
00:06:47.473 --> 00:06:48.904
Why can't I go through her stuff?

99
00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:03.454
Hi. Are you on your way to school?

100
00:07:03.894 --> 00:07:06.923
Yes. There is nowhere else to be at this time.

101
00:07:07.464 --> 00:07:09.464
Get in. I'm on my way to school too.

102
00:07:14.204 --> 00:07:15.334
Well...

103
00:07:27.944 --> 00:07:29.714
She even has a chauffeur?

104
00:07:30.113 --> 00:07:33.183
Well, that jerk wouldn't have went after her if she was poor.

105
00:07:33.623 --> 00:07:35.183
That jerk.

106
00:07:35.853 --> 00:07:37.954
Thank you for the other day.

107
00:07:39.194 --> 00:07:40.564
Don't mention it.

108
00:07:40.764 --> 00:07:42.793
I wanted to get back at him anyway.

109
00:07:43.394 --> 00:07:45.233
Did Hyun Seok get you too?

110
00:07:45.533 --> 00:07:47.264
Nobody had it bad like me.

111
00:07:47.264 --> 00:07:50.233
I can't sleep at night when I think of what he did to me.

112
00:07:50.373 --> 00:07:51.603
I wouldn't have held it in,

113
00:07:51.603 --> 00:07:53.373
if I didn't have to make ends meet.

114
00:07:53.873 --> 00:07:55.704
That little jerk...

115
00:07:56.043 --> 00:07:57.243
Don't take it from him anymore.

116
00:07:57.243 --> 00:07:58.873
Of course not. I...

117
00:08:01.014 --> 00:08:02.214
No.

118
00:08:02.413 --> 00:08:05.183
I need to make a living for my family.

119
00:08:05.283 --> 00:08:07.024
I'll help you not get bullied.

120
00:08:07.723 --> 00:08:09.053
Pardon? What?

121
00:08:09.353 --> 00:08:10.423
I can...

122
00:08:11.154 --> 00:08:13.623
help you not get bullied.

123
00:08:14.163 --> 00:08:15.163
What?

124
00:08:17.493 --> 00:08:18.733
I see.

125
00:08:22.933 --> 00:08:24.033
What's with her?

126
00:08:24.233 --> 00:08:25.803
Why she acting shy?

127
00:08:26.373 --> 00:08:27.404
Don't do it.

128
00:08:29.644 --> 00:08:32.714
So are you feeling better now?

129
00:08:34.243 --> 00:08:35.344
Yes, thanks to you.

130
00:08:39.584 --> 00:08:41.584
- I'll go to the restroom. - Okay.

131
00:08:43.454 --> 00:08:44.723
I got this.

132
00:08:46.164 --> 00:08:49.023
I'll pay for it as a celebration of your new start in life.

133
00:08:49.893 --> 00:08:51.464
Auntie. Bill, please.

134
00:08:51.733 --> 00:08:52.834
All right.

135
00:08:54.164 --> 00:08:55.204
Goodness.

136
00:08:55.633 --> 00:08:56.704
- Gosh. - Hey.

137
00:08:56.973 --> 00:08:58.034
You'll hurt yourself.

138
00:08:59.574 --> 00:09:01.473
Who broke this?

139
00:09:01.473 --> 00:09:03.473
This is from Thailand.

140
00:09:03.473 --> 00:09:04.844
- I'm sorry, I... - Auntie.

141
00:09:05.314 --> 00:09:08.143
I was just going to touch it, but I dropped it.

142
00:09:08.483 --> 00:09:11.613
I'll be going on a business trip to Thailand in 13 years.

143
00:09:11.883 --> 00:09:13.324
I'll buy you the same one then.

144
00:09:13.924 --> 00:09:14.954
I promise.

145
00:09:15.084 --> 00:09:16.393
You're so funny.

146
00:09:17.094 --> 00:09:18.554
Let me clean this up.

147
00:09:31.503 --> 00:09:33.873
This is a bit uncomfortable.

148
00:09:35.174 --> 00:09:37.714
Don't feel awkward just because I'm your senior.

149
00:09:37.973 --> 00:09:39.613
I'm not the type of woman...

150
00:09:39.613 --> 00:09:42.454
to have prejudice against older woman or something.

151
00:09:42.853 --> 00:09:43.914
Pardon?

152
00:09:46.883 --> 00:09:48.253
Well, okay.

153
00:09:48.383 --> 00:09:49.523
Do you...

154
00:09:49.824 --> 00:09:51.353
have a girlfriend?

155
00:09:51.723 --> 00:09:52.863
Pardon?

156
00:09:57.834 --> 00:10:00.534
I don't have one, but...

157
00:10:02.804 --> 00:10:04.704
- Good morning, director. - Good morning, director.

158
00:10:06.074 --> 00:10:07.074
Hello.

159
00:10:07.373 --> 00:10:08.473
Good morning.

160
00:10:17.054 --> 00:10:18.184
I feel like having a durian,

161
00:10:18.184 --> 00:10:19.983
the king of tropical fruit.

162
00:10:20.253 --> 00:10:22.023
I'll go buy it, sir!

163
00:10:23.424 --> 00:10:24.454
Are you still here?

164
00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:29.633
Mrs. Choi is here.

165
00:10:30.094 --> 00:10:31.794
- Good morning, Mrs. Choi. - Good morning, Mrs. Choi.

166
00:10:36.603 --> 00:10:37.934
Honey.

167
00:10:41.074 --> 00:10:42.174
No.

168
00:10:42.403 --> 00:10:43.613
What?

169
00:10:44.873 --> 00:10:46.844
It's nothing. Bye.

170
00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:52.084
Snap out of it.

171
00:10:52.253 --> 00:10:54.483
Ban Do, you can make money on your own.

172
00:10:54.753 --> 00:10:55.954
Of course you can.

173
00:10:58.353 --> 00:10:59.623
Jin Joo?

174
00:11:04.393 --> 00:11:06.534
Did she see me? Gosh.

175
00:11:06.534 --> 00:11:07.704
Did I do something wrong?

176
00:11:08.233 --> 00:11:09.434
Why am I avoiding her?

177
00:11:09.434 --> 00:11:10.603
Gosh.

178
00:11:12.444 --> 00:11:14.074
What's up with him?

179
00:11:19.414 --> 00:11:21.513
You should watch where you are going!

180
00:11:21.983 --> 00:11:24.253
Goodness. Are you blind?

181
00:11:24.653 --> 00:11:27.023
My shoes.

182
00:11:27.954 --> 00:11:29.554
I'm sorry, I...

183
00:11:29.554 --> 00:11:30.623
Don't you dare touch me.

184
00:11:31.753 --> 00:11:34.763
Do you know how much this costs?

185
00:11:35.424 --> 00:11:38.594
You can't buy it even if you sold your body.

186
00:11:38.694 --> 00:11:39.804
Hey.

187
00:11:40.704 --> 00:11:42.603
- "Hey"? - Let me handle this.

188
00:11:43.704 --> 00:11:46.544
How can you talk to a younger person like that as an elder?

189
00:11:46.544 --> 00:11:47.773
How expensive is it?

190
00:11:47.773 --> 00:11:48.973
Is it more expensive than a person?

191
00:11:48.973 --> 00:11:50.914
You don't know what she's going to become in the future.

192
00:11:51.814 --> 00:11:52.914
Who are you?

193
00:11:53.383 --> 00:11:56.184
How dare you speak to me like that? You look younger than my son.

194
00:11:56.184 --> 00:11:58.414
Let me tell you something as a person who also has a child.

195
00:11:58.414 --> 00:12:01.454
If you care so much for your child, respect others' children as well.

196
00:12:01.454 --> 00:12:03.694
It's because of people like you that even the kind moms...

197
00:12:03.694 --> 00:12:05.324
are considered to be malicious.

198
00:12:05.324 --> 00:12:07.794
Malicious?

199
00:12:09.594 --> 00:12:10.694
But come to think of it,

200
00:12:10.893 --> 00:12:14.263
why do you keep talking down to me?

201
00:12:14.664 --> 00:12:15.664
I...

202
00:12:20.503 --> 00:12:21.873
It's not like that.

203
00:12:21.873 --> 00:12:24.273
It's not like that. Why are you doing this to your mom?

204
00:12:24.373 --> 00:12:26.743
I didn't do anything wrong. It was her fault.

205
00:12:27.284 --> 00:12:28.414
Let me go!

206
00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:30.113
Gosh.

207
00:12:31.454 --> 00:12:33.983
Hey! Hey! Let me go!

208
00:12:36.753 --> 00:12:39.324
Why are you doing this... Why are you doing this to your mom?

209
00:12:39.324 --> 00:12:41.023
I didn't do it.

210
00:12:41.023 --> 00:12:42.893
She... She started it first.

211
00:12:42.893 --> 00:12:45.334
She started it first. Why are you picking on me, not her?

212
00:12:45.334 --> 00:12:47.834
It's not my fault.

213
00:12:47.834 --> 00:12:49.574
Why do you blame me?

214
00:12:49.574 --> 00:12:51.534
- You're not supposed to do that! - Excuse me.

215
00:12:52.034 --> 00:12:53.243
Thank you.

216
00:12:53.844 --> 00:12:56.044
It's nothing.

217
00:12:56.544 --> 00:12:59.844
It's just because I can't stand things like that.

218
00:13:03.954 --> 00:13:06.383
Everyone can be in love.

219
00:13:06.383 --> 00:13:09.123
But not everyone can succeed in love.

220
00:13:09.223 --> 00:13:10.223
Why do you think that is?

221
00:13:10.993 --> 00:13:13.424
Erich Fromm, a psychoanalyst...

222
00:13:13.424 --> 00:13:15.694
and a philosopher from America said that...

223
00:13:30.074 --> 00:13:31.844
"Love is irrelevant to maturity,"

224
00:13:31.844 --> 00:13:34.584
"and that not everyone..."

225
00:13:34.584 --> 00:13:37.653
"can achieve it easily."

226
00:13:37.954 --> 00:13:39.723
He's trying to say that...

227
00:13:39.883 --> 00:13:41.383
if you want to succeed in love,

228
00:13:41.383 --> 00:13:44.294
you need to put a lot of effort into maturing your personality.

229
00:13:45.054 --> 00:13:46.393
But it's not like...

230
00:13:46.393 --> 00:13:49.294
Fromm only emphasized the individual's effort.

231
00:13:49.294 --> 00:13:51.263
Have a nice weekend,

232
00:13:51.263 --> 00:13:52.363
and see you next week.

233
00:13:52.363 --> 00:13:55.434
- Yes, Professor. - Thank you.

234
00:13:57.034 --> 00:13:58.174
Attention, please.

235
00:13:58.534 --> 00:14:00.704
We're gathering signatures to demand the resignation of Director Jung.

236
00:14:00.704 --> 00:14:01.903
Please participate.

237
00:14:03.373 --> 00:14:05.914
Yes, he's asking for too much.

238
00:14:06.113 --> 00:14:08.444
The tuition fees are so expensive. We can't even pay for school.

239
00:14:08.444 --> 00:14:10.013
He just wants to drink the students' blood...

240
00:14:10.013 --> 00:14:11.314
to earn money.

241
00:14:13.924 --> 00:14:15.454
- What's wrong? - Gosh.

242
00:14:17.253 --> 00:14:18.794
(Demand for Resignation of the Director)

243
00:14:24.434 --> 00:14:28.204
These students don't really need to go this far.

244
00:14:28.304 --> 00:14:30.903
I didn't know it was your mom.

245
00:14:31.174 --> 00:14:34.103
If you get something like that on your clothes, it's uncomfortable.

246
00:14:34.103 --> 00:14:35.544
It's only right that she got angry.

247
00:14:35.544 --> 00:14:37.113
I was being too...

248
00:14:39.184 --> 00:14:40.284
Who's my mom?

249
00:14:42.653 --> 00:14:44.113
The person I met earlier...

250
00:14:45.214 --> 00:14:47.084
(Jung Nam Gil)

251
00:14:54.924 --> 00:14:56.034
I don't have a mom.

252
00:14:56.934 --> 00:14:57.964
Mind your own business.

253
00:15:05.503 --> 00:15:06.603
He's angry.

254
00:15:06.643 --> 00:15:09.444
I couldn't have possibly known that it was his mom.

255
00:15:14.844 --> 00:15:17.214
Does he really need to hide it like that?

256
00:15:28.523 --> 00:15:29.694
It's not like that.

257
00:15:29.694 --> 00:15:31.763
It's not like that. Why are you doing this to your mom?

258
00:15:31.763 --> 00:15:33.763
I didn't do anything wrong. It was her fault.

259
00:15:33.903 --> 00:15:36.003
Let me go. Let me go!

260
00:15:36.003 --> 00:15:37.834
She did it first!

261
00:15:37.834 --> 00:15:40.273
She did it first! Why would you do this to me?

262
00:15:47.444 --> 00:15:49.753
Guys, if you could be 20-year-old again,

263
00:15:49.753 --> 00:15:51.314
what would you want to do most?

264
00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:53.253
What are you even saying?

265
00:15:56.294 --> 00:15:58.723
Imagine this. You're 38 years old.

266
00:15:58.824 --> 00:16:00.623
But one day, you became a 20-year-old again.

267
00:16:00.824 --> 00:16:01.964
What would you want to do?

268
00:16:01.964 --> 00:16:03.194
I'd want to date someone.

269
00:16:03.194 --> 00:16:05.664
I would probably be married when I'm 38 years old.

270
00:16:05.664 --> 00:16:08.103
That means I have to live with one woman forever.

271
00:16:08.903 --> 00:16:11.304
No, no, no. It's so boring. I can't do that.

272
00:16:11.733 --> 00:16:12.873
You won't live like that.

273
00:16:12.873 --> 00:16:14.174
- Don't worry. - All right.

274
00:16:14.174 --> 00:16:16.914
I'd play everyday like I do right now.

275
00:16:16.914 --> 00:16:18.674
You should ask the person who's turning 20 again,

276
00:16:18.674 --> 00:16:19.983
not us.

277
00:16:21.513 --> 00:16:23.714
It's because I don't really know.

278
00:16:25.214 --> 00:16:26.924
I've been to a night club.

279
00:16:27.883 --> 00:16:28.954
What if you were a girl?

280
00:16:29.294 --> 00:16:30.723
What would you do?

281
00:16:30.723 --> 00:16:32.424
- I'd date someone. - All right.

282
00:16:32.424 --> 00:16:34.324
You should ask a girl, not us.

283
00:16:34.324 --> 00:16:35.863
What's wrong with you?

284
00:16:35.863 --> 00:16:36.863
Hey!

285
00:16:37.294 --> 00:16:40.003
Did you guys take down our posters in the corridor?

286
00:16:40.003 --> 00:16:41.003
Why would we?

287
00:16:41.003 --> 00:16:43.603
We fought over a club matter in the past.

288
00:16:43.603 --> 00:16:46.503
We don't even know what club you're in.

289
00:16:46.804 --> 00:16:47.873
Gosh.

290
00:16:51.674 --> 00:16:53.814
Gosh, who does he think we are?

291
00:16:56.084 --> 00:16:57.613
(Student Union)

292
00:16:58.914 --> 00:16:59.924
What's this?

293
00:17:00.954 --> 00:17:03.754
Hey, hey! Stop. Stop.

294
00:17:03.754 --> 00:17:05.054
What's this?

295
00:17:06.524 --> 00:17:08.363
(Let's go on a spontaneous trip!)

296
00:17:08.363 --> 00:17:10.863
- Spontaneous trip? - Goodness.

297
00:17:21.443 --> 00:17:22.574
- Hello. - Hello.

298
00:17:22.574 --> 00:17:23.713
Hello.

299
00:17:31.183 --> 00:17:32.524
Hello.

300
00:17:32.524 --> 00:17:34.224
Hello, Sul.

301
00:17:35.183 --> 00:17:37.423
Today, Sul,

302
00:17:37.824 --> 00:17:39.193
there's a group reservation...

303
00:17:42.933 --> 00:17:44.094
Where did she go?

304
00:17:47.103 --> 00:17:48.403
I'll be in front of the supermarket.

305
00:17:48.403 --> 00:17:49.734
Take your time.

306
00:17:50.034 --> 00:17:51.034
Okay.

307
00:17:55.774 --> 00:17:57.474
Tissues, money,

308
00:17:59.213 --> 00:18:00.383
towels...

309
00:18:00.383 --> 00:18:02.183
(Gunyoung Supermarket)

310
00:18:14.363 --> 00:18:16.294
What is this? Who are you?

311
00:18:16.633 --> 00:18:18.294
- Ta-da! - Ta-da!

312
00:18:19.203 --> 00:18:22.363
What is this? What are you doing?

313
00:18:22.363 --> 00:18:23.373
What do you think?

314
00:18:23.603 --> 00:18:26.574
It's a spontaneous trip!

315
00:18:28.274 --> 00:18:29.274
What?

316
00:18:29.643 --> 00:18:32.113
(Youths that have romantically run away from home!)

317
00:18:35.344 --> 00:18:37.784
Wait a minute. Bean sprouts, tofu,

318
00:18:37.784 --> 00:18:40.183
and ice cream? Who eats ice cream?

319
00:18:43.423 --> 00:18:44.423
"Bong Bong"?

320
00:18:48.064 --> 00:18:50.393
Darling!

321
00:18:50.534 --> 00:18:52.863
- Darling! Darling! - What's wrong?

322
00:18:52.863 --> 00:18:54.304
- What is it? - Darling!

323
00:18:54.304 --> 00:18:58.974
Darling, "Bong Bong" is not here.

324
00:18:58.974 --> 00:19:01.044
What are you talking about? Who's that?

325
00:19:01.044 --> 00:19:03.143
Our car, "Bong Bong".

326
00:19:03.143 --> 00:19:06.143
Bong Bong, my love and my favorite car, is not here.

327
00:19:06.143 --> 00:19:07.213
Right.

328
00:19:07.683 --> 00:19:09.814
I saw Ban Do going through the drawers.

329
00:19:09.814 --> 00:19:11.984
- He must have taken it. - What?

330
00:19:11.984 --> 00:19:15.724
Your license got suspended anyway. You can't ride it.

331
00:19:15.724 --> 00:19:16.794
Just let him.

332
00:19:16.794 --> 00:19:18.953
What? What do you mean?

333
00:19:19.423 --> 00:19:21.123
How can he drive?

334
00:19:21.123 --> 00:19:22.324
His license...

335
00:19:23.193 --> 00:19:25.264
His license...

336
00:19:25.264 --> 00:19:27.633
Gosh, my neck's so stiff.

337
00:19:28.534 --> 00:19:29.903
Here, my license.

338
00:19:29.903 --> 00:19:32.234
Gosh, why don't you trust me right away?

339
00:19:32.234 --> 00:19:33.804
Wait, let me see.

340
00:19:33.804 --> 00:19:36.613
Hey, you got this a month ago?

341
00:19:36.613 --> 00:19:37.643
What?

342
00:19:37.913 --> 00:19:39.314
Hey, wait. Stop the car.

343
00:19:39.314 --> 00:19:40.814
I want to get out. Stop the car.

344
00:19:40.814 --> 00:19:42.754
Hey, we should have put up a sign...

345
00:19:42.754 --> 00:19:44.653
saying "Novice Driver" instead of this.

346
00:19:44.653 --> 00:19:45.923
Gosh, I'm not a novice.

347
00:19:45.923 --> 00:19:48.784
I've been driving for 15 years.

348
00:19:48.784 --> 00:19:50.524
Gosh, I'm no novice.

349
00:19:50.524 --> 00:19:53.123
Tell them, Jin Joo.

350
00:19:54.094 --> 00:19:55.494
Gosh, that's not important.

351
00:19:55.494 --> 00:19:56.863
Stop the car.

352
00:19:56.863 --> 00:19:58.064
I can't go.

353
00:19:58.594 --> 00:20:00.403
Aren't you supposed to be working today, Sul?

354
00:20:00.403 --> 00:20:01.764
Yes, I am.

355
00:20:01.764 --> 00:20:04.034
But he let me take time off.

356
00:20:04.804 --> 00:20:06.544
Why don't you like it? I like it.

357
00:20:06.673 --> 00:20:08.603
Let's go. It'll be a great memory in the future.

358
00:20:08.603 --> 00:20:10.643
We won't ever get a chance to leave spontaneously.

359
00:20:10.643 --> 00:20:12.173
Sul won't be able to take time off.

360
00:20:12.173 --> 00:20:14.544
She's right. And I think it's going to be fun.

361
00:20:14.544 --> 00:20:16.153
Let's go, Jin Joo.

362
00:20:16.153 --> 00:20:17.784
Let's go.

363
00:20:19.183 --> 00:20:20.183
Okay. Let's go.

364
00:20:20.554 --> 00:20:21.554
Let's go.

365
00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:23.054
Okay!

366
00:20:24.953 --> 00:20:26.494
- Let's go! - Let's go.

367
00:20:26.494 --> 00:20:28.064
Let's go to the sea!

368
00:20:28.064 --> 00:20:29.764
- Let's go! - Let's go!

369
00:20:34.663 --> 00:20:35.663
Go!

370
00:20:41.603 --> 00:20:42.613
Go!

371
00:20:58.794 --> 00:20:59.794
A trip?

372
00:21:00.693 --> 00:21:01.724
Yes.

373
00:21:02.024 --> 00:21:04.693
She says that her friends suddenly took her or something.

374
00:21:04.693 --> 00:21:07.633
Gosh, but how could she just leave the bottles over there?

375
00:21:07.633 --> 00:21:09.103
That mindless girl.

376
00:21:09.103 --> 00:21:11.734
It's fine. We found it. That's what's important.

377
00:21:12.103 --> 00:21:13.673
Gosh, these kids,

378
00:21:13.673 --> 00:21:15.544
why are they so spontaneous?

379
00:21:16.143 --> 00:21:17.544
They're still young.

380
00:21:17.673 --> 00:21:18.673
Wait.

381
00:21:19.514 --> 00:21:21.413
Are you sure she went with friends?

382
00:21:21.683 --> 00:21:23.183
Did you hear girls' voices?

383
00:21:23.183 --> 00:21:25.883
Gosh, you're saying unnecessary things again.

384
00:21:25.883 --> 00:21:27.284
It's even better if she went with a boy.

385
00:21:27.284 --> 00:21:28.524
We can send one away.

386
00:21:28.524 --> 00:21:29.754
No.

387
00:21:29.754 --> 00:21:32.054
I haven't figured out if I should...

388
00:21:32.054 --> 00:21:34.123
send her to that rich boy's house or not.

389
00:21:35.024 --> 00:21:36.363
What do you mean?

390
00:21:36.633 --> 00:21:39.863
Are you saying that Seo Jin or whatever is rich?

391
00:21:40.703 --> 00:21:41.903
Did she write that in her journal?

392
00:21:42.264 --> 00:21:43.474
Wait, who's this guy?

393
00:21:43.534 --> 00:21:44.603
Isn't it him?

394
00:21:44.673 --> 00:21:45.844
If not,

395
00:21:46.143 --> 00:21:47.943
is it Choi Ban Do?

396
00:21:48.703 --> 00:21:51.113
Choi Ban Do? It's not him either.

397
00:21:52.014 --> 00:21:53.913
His name was Nam Gil.

398
00:21:53.984 --> 00:21:55.953
Was it Park Nam Gil? Or Kim Nam Gil?

399
00:21:56.883 --> 00:21:58.383
Anyway,

400
00:21:59.524 --> 00:22:01.524
he's the son of the director of Hankook University.

401
00:22:01.653 --> 00:22:02.724
What?

402
00:22:03.123 --> 00:22:04.824
Why would someone like him like my daughter?

403
00:22:05.653 --> 00:22:08.393
What kind of nonsense is this?

404
00:22:10.564 --> 00:22:13.403
What was his name again? Right, Choi Ban Do.

405
00:22:13.963 --> 00:22:15.334
I like him the best.

406
00:22:15.834 --> 00:22:19.443
He looks very smart, so he won't starve her.

407
00:22:19.873 --> 00:22:22.443
Ban Do, I'm hungry.

408
00:22:28.344 --> 00:22:31.353
Are we going to get there within the day, Mr. Driver?

409
00:22:32.113 --> 00:22:33.423
You don't know where you're going, do you?

410
00:22:33.953 --> 00:22:36.953
Do you think I got nothing out of working as a salesman?

411
00:22:37.324 --> 00:22:40.463
I went all around this country to sell drugs.

412
00:22:40.463 --> 00:22:43.064
I have the entire map of Korea in my head.

413
00:22:43.334 --> 00:22:44.994
My gosh.

414
00:22:46.203 --> 00:22:49.064
Goodness, there should be a tunnel somewhere here.

415
00:22:49.974 --> 00:22:51.574
I'm so hungry.

416
00:22:51.574 --> 00:22:53.044
Which tunnel are you talking about?

417
00:22:53.044 --> 00:22:55.443
Daegwallyeong Tunnel. Gangneung Interchange comes right after.

418
00:22:55.443 --> 00:22:58.044
- We're almost there. Hold on. - Hey.

419
00:22:58.274 --> 00:23:00.044
I told you to wait quietly.

420
00:23:00.713 --> 00:23:01.784
No, that's not it.

421
00:23:02.683 --> 00:23:04.613
Where is this Daegwallyeong Tunnel?

422
00:23:04.713 --> 00:23:05.713
What?

423
00:23:06.584 --> 00:23:07.754
Isn't it on the map?

424
00:23:08.324 --> 00:23:11.324
Wait, wasn't it open back in 1999?

425
00:23:11.693 --> 00:23:12.923
Darn it.

426
00:23:12.923 --> 00:23:15.524
What are you doing? I'm hungry. Just stop the car.

427
00:23:15.594 --> 00:23:17.163
There's not a tunnel around here.

428
00:23:27.044 --> 00:23:28.103
I'm so tired.

429
00:23:28.103 --> 00:23:29.173
My goodness.

430
00:23:31.173 --> 00:23:32.984
My gosh.

431
00:23:33.413 --> 00:23:36.213
I didn't know this was a time before there was Daegwallyeong Tunnel.

432
00:23:36.683 --> 00:23:38.554
Where on earth are we?

433
00:23:38.683 --> 00:23:41.183
Exactly. I can't tell because I can't see a thing.

434
00:23:41.484 --> 00:23:42.623
I can't see a thing.

435
00:23:43.824 --> 00:23:44.893
- Take off your sunglasses. - You're right.

436
00:23:45.824 --> 00:23:47.863
- Aren't you hungry? - I am.

437
00:23:47.863 --> 00:23:49.834
I'm starving.

438
00:23:50.463 --> 00:23:52.933
You definitely don't have the map in your head.

439
00:23:54.203 --> 00:23:56.834
Hey, didn't you go grocery shopping?

440
00:23:57.103 --> 00:23:58.673
Of course, I did.

441
00:23:58.774 --> 00:23:59.804
Look.

442
00:24:01.274 --> 00:24:03.514
We'll make pigs sad if we don't eat pork belly...

443
00:24:03.514 --> 00:24:05.244
- when we're on a trip. - Of course.

444
00:24:05.344 --> 00:24:07.183
How much did you get?

445
00:24:07.183 --> 00:24:08.344
I got 600g per person.

446
00:24:08.443 --> 00:24:10.784
And 1.2kg for guys, so I have 5.4kg of meat.

447
00:24:10.953 --> 00:24:12.853
- What? - 5.4kg?

448
00:24:13.284 --> 00:24:15.893
What did these pigs do to deserve this from you?

449
00:24:15.923 --> 00:24:17.423
1.8kg would've been enough.

450
00:24:17.554 --> 00:24:18.923
Who's going to eat all these?

451
00:24:18.923 --> 00:24:20.764
I thought 600g was a single portion.

452
00:24:22.324 --> 00:24:24.933
I hope you didn't only get meat, did you?

453
00:24:25.034 --> 00:24:27.534
No way. What do you think of us?

454
00:24:28.334 --> 00:24:29.433
I got some soup.

455
00:24:31.804 --> 00:24:35.004
Fine, let's eat meat until we drop down and die.

456
00:24:35.373 --> 00:24:37.344
Our stomachs will be surprised.

457
00:24:38.774 --> 00:24:40.344
- Let's eat. - Okay, let's eat.

458
00:24:43.353 --> 00:24:44.613
Wait just a little longer.

459
00:24:48.123 --> 00:24:50.453
You're all of an age when you eat quite a lot.

460
00:24:50.524 --> 00:24:52.123
- It's done. Eat up. - Let's eat!

461
00:24:52.123 --> 00:24:53.893
- Wow. - All right.

462
00:24:56.133 --> 00:24:57.163
My gosh.

463
00:24:57.334 --> 00:24:58.834
- This is great. - It's so good.

464
00:25:00.203 --> 00:25:02.264
Man, Ban Do. You know how to grill meat.

465
00:25:02.264 --> 00:25:04.474
- All right, cheers. - Cheers!

466
00:25:08.744 --> 00:25:11.113
It really feels like we're on a trip. This is so much fun.

467
00:25:11.474 --> 00:25:12.613
I'll put this in here.

468
00:25:12.713 --> 00:25:18.584
Hold back your tears now

469
00:25:18.754 --> 00:25:24.893
Even the sky is blessing us

470
00:25:25.863 --> 00:25:28.923
Like this

471
00:25:28.923 --> 00:25:33.133
The sky is open for us

472
00:25:33.334 --> 00:25:37.433
And you are beside me

473
00:25:37.673 --> 00:25:41.903
You're standing there with a blue smile

474
00:25:42.044 --> 00:25:44.713
Yes, you're the blue ocean

475
00:25:44.844 --> 00:25:48.014
I will love

476
00:25:48.383 --> 00:25:51.113
I will love

477
00:25:51.413 --> 00:25:55.453
I won't let anyone find out

478
00:25:55.623 --> 00:25:58.724
It's only for you

479
00:25:58.893 --> 00:26:02.163
Keep your eyes on me

480
00:26:02.324 --> 00:26:06.703
Keep your eyes on me

481
00:26:07.163 --> 00:26:12.443
The love that no one knows about

482
00:26:15.643 --> 00:26:16.744
You're so cool!

483
00:26:19.613 --> 00:26:20.883
And bow.

484
00:26:24.084 --> 00:26:29.054
Whenever I look into your eyes

485
00:26:29.824 --> 00:26:34.363
Everything seems like a dream

486
00:26:35.524 --> 00:26:38.863
Of these many people in this world

487
00:26:39.064 --> 00:26:44.774
How did us two end up together?

488
00:26:44.933 --> 00:26:49.974
Maybe it was a miracle

489
00:26:49.974 --> 00:26:53.844
Whenever I am in your arms

490
00:26:54.784 --> 00:26:58.683
I find a new side of me

491
00:26:59.254 --> 00:27:03.224
Before I knew you

492
00:27:03.393 --> 00:27:07.893
I don't remember how I lived

493
00:27:08.163 --> 00:27:15.663
Maybe I was a living dead

494
00:27:15.663 --> 00:27:22.304
How did we miss each other like this?

495
00:27:22.304 --> 00:27:28.844
We were always so close to one another

496
00:27:30.213 --> 00:27:36.324
We do not even have enough time to love each other

497
00:29:20.594 --> 00:29:22.494
- My gosh. - What are they doing here?

498
00:29:22.494 --> 00:29:24.133
Someone wake them up.

499
00:29:24.863 --> 00:29:26.564
- Wake them up. - Hey, wake up.

500
00:29:26.564 --> 00:29:28.034
- Wake up. - What are you doing?

501
00:29:28.034 --> 00:29:30.234
You can't do this in a construction site.

502
00:29:30.234 --> 00:29:31.673
Get up already.

503
00:29:31.933 --> 00:29:33.974
- Get up. - What are you doing?

504
00:29:37.143 --> 00:29:39.544
Are you all crazy?

505
00:29:40.183 --> 00:29:41.443
I'm sorry.

506
00:29:42.953 --> 00:29:44.784
Move these already.

507
00:29:44.853 --> 00:29:46.683
- I'm sorry. - What are you doing here?

508
00:29:52.123 --> 00:29:53.663
My gosh, what?

509
00:29:59.203 --> 00:30:00.463
What? Hey.

510
00:30:00.703 --> 00:30:02.774
Hey, Jin Joo. Wake up.

511
00:30:07.504 --> 00:30:08.574
Hey.

512
00:30:08.844 --> 00:30:10.744
What's with your face?

513
00:30:11.014 --> 00:30:12.344
And what's with you?

514
00:30:12.413 --> 00:30:13.484
My gosh.

515
00:30:13.683 --> 00:30:16.254
Goodness, they're all so childish.

516
00:30:16.254 --> 00:30:17.514
My gosh.

517
00:30:17.554 --> 00:30:18.853
What's with my face?

518
00:30:23.423 --> 00:30:25.554
Ban Do, you little kid!

519
00:30:36.774 --> 00:30:38.804
Wow, that's such a masterpiece.

520
00:30:38.834 --> 00:30:41.974
It's a portrait. That's what you look like when you're angry.

521
00:30:41.974 --> 00:30:43.713
Why would you say that? Darn you.

522
00:30:43.873 --> 00:30:46.484
You look exactly like that.

523
00:30:47.113 --> 00:30:49.113
Why are you erasing it off?

524
00:30:49.484 --> 00:30:50.883
It's really funny though.

525
00:30:51.984 --> 00:30:53.383
Stop laughing at me.

526
00:30:56.054 --> 00:30:57.393
You should look at your own face.

527
00:30:57.393 --> 00:30:58.494
Your face is funnier.

528
00:30:58.653 --> 00:31:00.294
Hey, stop erasing it off.

529
00:31:05.234 --> 00:31:06.363
Are you leaving now?

530
00:31:06.703 --> 00:31:07.734
Yes.

531
00:31:09.334 --> 00:31:11.734
You always look so cool in your uniform.

532
00:31:12.373 --> 00:31:14.873
Is everything all right at school?

533
00:31:15.443 --> 00:31:17.613
It looks like there's a talk about your dad resigning.

534
00:31:17.943 --> 00:31:20.344
He's just reaping what he sowed.

535
00:31:20.784 --> 00:31:21.913
What?

536
00:31:24.913 --> 00:31:26.853
He'll manage to survive no matter what he does,

537
00:31:26.853 --> 00:31:27.984
so don't worry.

538
00:31:29.453 --> 00:31:30.554
It's not that...

539

540
00:32:13.933 --> 00:32:16.074
Gosh. What?

541
00:32:16.433 --> 00:32:18.334
Let go. Let me go!

542
00:32:18.334 --> 00:32:20.203
Hey. Let go!

543
00:32:20.673 --> 00:32:22.613
Let me go. Now!

544
00:32:22.613 --> 00:32:23.643
Let go!

545
00:32:23.643 --> 00:32:25.673
Goodness.

546
00:32:29.514 --> 00:32:32.084
I should've yanked her hair.

547
00:32:32.084 --> 00:32:33.554
Because of you...

548
00:32:33.554 --> 00:32:34.953
If she dares to...

549
00:32:34.953 --> 00:32:37.923
take even a penny from my son's fortune,

550
00:32:37.923 --> 00:32:40.794
I'm going to... Gosh.

551
00:32:50.334 --> 00:32:51.334
Get out.

552
00:32:52.173 --> 00:32:53.544
Take me to Cheongdam-dong.

553
00:32:56.443 --> 00:32:58.744
Do you like picking up garbage you threw out?

554
00:33:00.613 --> 00:33:02.044
What are you saying?

555
00:33:03.113 --> 00:33:04.853
Why am I your son?

556
00:33:05.683 --> 00:33:07.784
You threw me out like trash,

557
00:33:08.824 --> 00:33:09.893
don't pick it up again.

558
00:33:12.153 --> 00:33:13.163
It's dirty.

559
00:33:14.764 --> 00:33:16.663
What?

560
00:33:18.893 --> 00:33:21.963
My goodness.

561
00:33:25.774 --> 00:33:27.274
Why do you think I came?

562
00:33:28.173 --> 00:33:29.514
I came to give you a gift.

563
00:33:53.903 --> 00:33:55.564
(Jayeon Hospital)

564
00:34:24.193 --> 00:34:25.293
- Dok Jae. - Yes?

565
00:34:25.293 --> 00:34:26.403
Look out the window.

566
00:34:26.403 --> 00:34:27.403
Window?

567
00:34:33.574 --> 00:34:35.273
Hey, wake up!

568
00:34:35.273 --> 00:34:38.173
Ocean to your right! It's the ocean!

569
00:34:42.954 --> 00:34:44.854
- It's really pretty. - Gosh.

570
00:34:46.923 --> 00:34:48.954
There's a lighthouse. It's pretty.

571
00:34:48.954 --> 00:34:51.224
Look at the waves.

572
00:34:51.253 --> 00:34:52.664
- Nice. - Gosh.

573
00:34:54.023 --> 00:34:55.394
I'm so happy!

574
00:34:55.793 --> 00:34:56.863
It's the sea.

575
00:34:59.503 --> 00:35:01.434
We'll arrive at the destination soon.

576
00:35:01.434 --> 00:35:03.374
Let's scream!

577
00:35:23.023 --> 00:35:25.153
Jin Joo, why don't you come in?

578
00:35:25.653 --> 00:35:28.124
I'm okay out here. You go on.

579
00:35:42.244 --> 00:35:44.213
They're so young.

580
00:36:04.193 --> 00:36:05.764
The washroom is locked up.

581
00:36:06.003 --> 00:36:07.764
I never got to wash my face this morning.

582
00:36:07.764 --> 00:36:09.304
Why are you kicking up a fuss here...

583
00:36:09.304 --> 00:36:10.874
when you don't even shower at home?

584
00:36:10.874 --> 00:36:12.503
Just wash yourselves here.

585
00:36:12.503 --> 00:36:13.543
Yes, just do it here.

586
00:36:13.543 --> 00:36:15.104
I don't think there's anywhere else to shower.

587
00:36:15.104 --> 00:36:17.074
- Hey. - What?

588
00:36:17.074 --> 00:36:18.113
Come on.

589
00:36:18.514 --> 00:36:19.514
Hey.

590
00:36:24.483 --> 00:36:25.583
Hey.

591
00:36:25.583 --> 00:36:27.523
- Hey! You're all dead! - What?

592
00:36:27.523 --> 00:36:29.253
- Hey! - Stop!

593
00:36:29.253 --> 00:36:30.594
Come on.

594
00:36:30.594 --> 00:36:33.363
Don't do it.

595
00:36:35.664 --> 00:36:37.563
Come here!

596
00:36:43.604 --> 00:36:45.003
- Ban Do did it. - I'm sorry.

597
00:36:48.844 --> 00:36:50.474
Why you little...

598
00:36:51.244 --> 00:36:53.043
You're all dead. Hey!

599
00:36:54.184 --> 00:36:55.443
I'll get you!

600
00:36:56.454 --> 00:36:57.684
What are you doing?

601
00:37:44.264 --> 00:37:45.394
Honey, here's some water.

602
00:37:50.534 --> 00:37:51.534
Aren't you tired?

603
00:37:51.534 --> 00:37:53.804
We come here all the time.

604
00:37:53.804 --> 00:37:55.503
I'm not tired at all.

605
00:37:57.374 --> 00:38:00.414
Anyway, is she having fun?

606
00:38:00.443 --> 00:38:02.313
She should stay there longer.

607
00:38:02.313 --> 00:38:03.554
Why is she coming back tomorrow?

608
00:38:03.554 --> 00:38:06.124
No. She has to go to school.

609
00:38:06.124 --> 00:38:07.583
Come on.

610
00:38:07.583 --> 00:38:09.894
Missing a day of school won't kill her.

611
00:38:09.894 --> 00:38:11.994
Kids should play.

612
00:38:12.423 --> 00:38:13.724
You're right.

613
00:38:14.264 --> 00:38:16.034
- It's our turn. - Okay.

614
00:38:16.833 --> 00:38:18.133
The weather's great.

615
00:38:23.233 --> 00:38:24.304
Sir.

616
00:38:25.333 --> 00:38:27.704
Don't you see these jugs lined up?

617
00:38:27.704 --> 00:38:28.874
It's our turn.

618
00:38:29.673 --> 00:38:31.443
Then you should've come here quick.

619
00:38:31.443 --> 00:38:33.983
I'm getting water first because you took so long.

620
00:38:34.983 --> 00:38:38.514
It took 10 seconds for me to get here from there.

621
00:38:38.514 --> 00:38:39.824
What do you mean I took so long?

622
00:38:39.824 --> 00:38:40.824
10 seconds?

623
00:38:41.253 --> 00:38:43.094
1, 2, 3...

624
00:38:43.324 --> 00:38:46.764
I can fill more than half of this jug with 10 seconds.

625
00:38:46.894 --> 00:38:48.063
You should go ahead first.

626
00:38:48.063 --> 00:38:49.733
Honey, it won't be long.

627
00:38:49.733 --> 00:38:52.034
Honey, what's going on? Did you cut in line again?

628
00:38:52.034 --> 00:38:53.563
Gosh.

629
00:38:53.563 --> 00:38:55.974
- I'm sorry. - Why are you saying sorry?

630
00:38:56.434 --> 00:38:58.403
Let me go. Look.

631
00:38:58.574 --> 00:39:01.574
There are water spring ethics and order.

632
00:39:01.574 --> 00:39:02.673
Helping someone get water...

633
00:39:02.673 --> 00:39:05.244
by holding their jugs is ethics and order.

634
00:39:05.514 --> 00:39:07.713
You're so selfish and disrespectful.

635
00:39:07.713 --> 00:39:10.014
What? Selfish and disrespectful?

636
00:39:10.014 --> 00:39:12.554
How dare you talk to a man that way?

637
00:39:12.554 --> 00:39:14.854
What? What did you say?

638
00:39:14.854 --> 00:39:17.423
"How dare you?" How dare you talk to my wife like that?

639
00:39:17.423 --> 00:39:19.963
Goodness. Mister, why are you grabbing him?

640
00:39:19.963 --> 00:39:21.423
- Why you... - Let him go.

641
00:39:21.423 --> 00:39:23.333
- Let him go. - Why you...

642
00:39:24.494 --> 00:39:27.063
- You punk... - I'm sorry.

643
00:39:27.804 --> 00:39:28.804
Gosh.

644
00:39:29.503 --> 00:39:30.503
Goodness.

645
00:39:30.503 --> 00:39:32.704
How dare you grab me by my throat?

646
00:39:32.844 --> 00:39:34.943
Your kids will be learning some great things from you.

647
00:39:34.943 --> 00:39:37.374
- Honey. - My neck.

648
00:39:37.374 --> 00:39:38.374
Hey!

649
00:39:38.773 --> 00:39:39.813
Please, don't.

650
00:39:40.483 --> 00:39:42.383
You better raise your kids right.

651
00:39:42.383 --> 00:39:45.213
I'd hate to have a son-in-law like you, old geezer.

652
00:39:45.213 --> 00:39:46.324
Hey!

653
00:39:46.724 --> 00:39:48.054
Why you stupid...

654
00:39:48.054 --> 00:39:49.423
How dare you throw water at me?

655
00:39:49.423 --> 00:39:51.293
I'd hate to have a daughter-in-law like you.

656
00:39:51.293 --> 00:39:54.063
- Honey, are you okay? - Hey.

657
00:40:35.363 --> 00:40:36.374
Is this it?

658
00:40:40.474 --> 00:40:41.903
It's that Nam Gil?

659
00:40:45.313 --> 00:40:46.514
Why is he here?

660
00:40:47.483 --> 00:40:49.014
This is hard to call coincidence.

661
00:40:49.014 --> 00:40:51.083
This must be fate, don't you think?

662
00:40:53.184 --> 00:40:54.184
Did you call him?

663
00:40:54.753 --> 00:40:55.954
Why would I?

664
00:40:56.594 --> 00:40:57.594
Well...

665
00:40:58.224 --> 00:40:59.494
I called him.

666
00:41:00.724 --> 00:41:01.764
- What? - What?

667
00:41:14.773 --> 00:41:15.974
I'm sorry.

668
00:41:16.543 --> 00:41:18.144
Something urgent came up.

669
00:41:18.144 --> 00:41:20.914
Hey, how can you miss a senior's wedding ceremony?

670
00:41:20.914 --> 00:41:23.483
I had to find someone to replace you last minute.

671
00:41:23.483 --> 00:41:24.883
I'll treat everyone to dinner.

672
00:41:25.684 --> 00:41:26.724
I'm really sorry.

673
00:41:32.724 --> 00:41:34.164
(June 1 - 30, 1999 in Ilwon, Gangneung-si)

674
00:41:34.894 --> 00:41:38.233
(Village attraction, firefly)

675
00:41:43.374 --> 00:41:44.434
Yes.

676
00:41:48.204 --> 00:41:49.344
I don't have a mom.

677
00:41:50.213 --> 00:41:51.313
Mind your own business.

678
00:41:54.983 --> 00:41:56.153
It's all dry now.

679
00:41:56.753 --> 00:41:57.883
It dried up really fast.

680
00:42:05.193 --> 00:42:06.193
Hey.

681
00:42:06.793 --> 00:42:07.793
Hey!

682
00:42:08.764 --> 00:42:10.193
Why are you glaring at him?

683
00:42:11.133 --> 00:42:13.164
It's fun to hang out together.

684
00:42:13.403 --> 00:42:14.434
I think so too.

685
00:42:15.104 --> 00:42:16.204
By the way,

686
00:42:16.204 --> 00:42:17.804
why did you call him?

687
00:42:18.534 --> 00:42:19.644
Do you...

688
00:42:20.003 --> 00:42:21.043
like him?

689
00:42:21.844 --> 00:42:22.943
Do you want me to help you?

690
00:42:23.213 --> 00:42:25.273
Me? No.

691
00:42:26.014 --> 00:42:27.344
He likes...

692
00:42:28.483 --> 00:42:29.554
her.

693
00:42:30.983 --> 00:42:33.523
He came running here when I told him she's here.

694
00:42:35.454 --> 00:42:37.324
My goodness.

695
00:42:37.324 --> 00:42:39.963
You didn't have to tell everyone about this.

696
00:42:39.963 --> 00:42:41.164
Gosh.

697
00:42:41.764 --> 00:42:43.333
Why did he come here like that?

698
00:42:44.333 --> 00:42:47.363
Should we take a photo of him and report him to the ROTC?

699
00:42:47.534 --> 00:42:48.534
Yes.

700
00:42:49.173 --> 00:42:50.534
That he's ruining the name.

701
00:42:51.604 --> 00:42:53.204
He looks really cool.

702
00:42:53.244 --> 00:42:55.204
That's why women fantasize about men in uniforms.

703
00:42:55.344 --> 00:42:57.443
What kind of genre is that?

704
00:43:03.514 --> 00:43:05.653
- See? - See?

705
00:43:06.784 --> 00:43:08.624
Gosh, what's wrong with them?

706
00:43:08.854 --> 00:43:10.054
Are you going to a kindergarten?

707
00:43:10.054 --> 00:43:11.394
Don't you even think about others?

708
00:43:11.653 --> 00:43:13.894
You're the ones wearing it, but we are the ones that see it.

709
00:43:13.894 --> 00:43:14.923
Hey.

710
00:43:15.124 --> 00:43:16.193
Do you want to fight me?

711
00:43:16.333 --> 00:43:17.363
No.

712
00:43:17.693 --> 00:43:19.733
This is so hard to come by.

713
00:43:19.833 --> 00:43:21.104
He's just jealous.

714
00:43:21.264 --> 00:43:23.074
- Right? - Right.

715
00:43:23.403 --> 00:43:26.344
We have two left for tomorrow. Do you want them?

716
00:43:27.903 --> 00:43:28.943
No.

717
00:43:36.414 --> 00:43:37.684
Here.

718
00:43:38.954 --> 00:43:40.824
- It looks delicious. - Eat up.

719
00:43:41.854 --> 00:43:43.124
Thank you.

720
00:43:43.124 --> 00:43:44.193
Thank you.

721
00:44:00.474 --> 00:44:03.773
Why did you come here in that uncomfortable looking suit?

722
00:44:03.844 --> 00:44:05.983
You're making us feel uncomfortable.

723
00:44:06.014 --> 00:44:07.113
I'm not uncomfortable.

724
00:44:07.113 --> 00:44:08.144
Me neither.

725
00:44:09.284 --> 00:44:10.354
I came out to get some fresh air.

726
00:44:10.813 --> 00:44:11.914
I felt stuffy.

727
00:44:12.014 --> 00:44:13.923
You came so far for some fresh air.

728
00:44:15.454 --> 00:44:17.753
But why do you keep talking down to an elder?

729
00:44:18.693 --> 00:44:19.923
Have some respect.

730
00:44:19.923 --> 00:44:20.963
Are you out of your mind?

731
00:44:20.963 --> 00:44:22.224
I'm so much older than him.

732
00:44:24.434 --> 00:44:26.104
- He's out of his mind. - He's crazy.

733
00:44:26.804 --> 00:44:27.804
It's all right.

734
00:44:28.733 --> 00:44:31.003
I don't pay attention to people who don't deserve it.

735
00:44:31.633 --> 00:44:33.403
I don't deserve it?

736
00:44:33.474 --> 00:44:34.543
- No. - Me?

737
00:44:35.744 --> 00:44:36.813
Why is that?

738
00:44:37.213 --> 00:44:39.983
I think you need to be concerned.

739
00:44:40.284 --> 00:44:41.943
If you find out the truth,

740
00:44:42.083 --> 00:44:44.383
you'd be really concerned about me.

741
00:44:44.383 --> 00:44:45.383
- Hey! - Hey!

742
00:44:49.994 --> 00:44:51.293
I... Well...

743
00:44:52.423 --> 00:44:56.894
You shouldn't do that to my guest. What's wrong with you?

744
00:44:57.133 --> 00:44:58.963
I know, right?

745
00:45:00.534 --> 00:45:02.633
But you do look uncomfortable.

746
00:45:03.003 --> 00:45:05.633
Don't you have any clothes to change into?

747
00:45:06.003 --> 00:45:07.104
It's all right.

748
00:45:08.003 --> 00:45:09.244
I got used to it.

749
00:45:09.374 --> 00:45:11.543
But you look cool in that uniform.

750
00:45:11.673 --> 00:45:13.514
- He's handsome too. - Yes.

751
00:45:14.213 --> 00:45:15.213
Thank you.

752
00:45:15.213 --> 00:45:17.313
A man isn't about his looks.

753
00:45:18.054 --> 00:45:19.224
Pass me that.

754
00:45:19.483 --> 00:45:21.124
What? This?

755
00:45:21.383 --> 00:45:22.923
Not that. The one next to it.

756
00:45:23.023 --> 00:45:24.094
What?

757
00:45:39.273 --> 00:45:41.074
It's really great here.

758
00:45:41.173 --> 00:45:42.474
I've never visited Gangneung before.

759
00:45:42.543 --> 00:45:43.744
- Really? - Yes.

760
00:45:43.974 --> 00:45:46.443
So Gangneung is the first place we've traveled together.

761
00:45:48.744 --> 00:45:49.784
Gosh.

762
00:45:49.954 --> 00:45:51.753
Have you been here before?

763
00:45:56.293 --> 00:45:57.354
I don't know.

764
00:45:57.724 --> 00:45:59.164
I don't remember.

765
00:46:03.894 --> 00:46:06.003
Hey, why are you so clumsy?

766
00:46:12.804 --> 00:46:14.704
Gosh, it just got dry.

767
00:46:15.543 --> 00:46:17.213
It's fine. It'll dry off soon.

768
00:46:17.673 --> 00:46:19.344
But it'll smell of beer.

769
00:46:19.383 --> 00:46:20.914
Yes, it'll smell.

770
00:46:21.483 --> 00:46:22.554
There's no choice.

771
00:46:23.213 --> 00:46:24.914
Ta-da! You should wear this.

772
00:46:25.153 --> 00:46:26.224
All right.

773
00:46:27.824 --> 00:46:29.454
I'll give it back to you after I wash it tomorrow.

774
00:46:30.054 --> 00:46:31.054
Excuse me.

775
00:46:31.523 --> 00:46:32.693
Can I wear that too?

776
00:46:34.193 --> 00:46:35.934
My uniform feels so uncomfortable.

777
00:46:36.764 --> 00:46:39.863
I knew it. It looked uncomfortable.

778
00:46:40.604 --> 00:46:41.733
Hey.

779
00:46:43.333 --> 00:46:44.503
I want to wear it.

780
00:46:45.503 --> 00:46:46.943
Why? Your clothes have dried off.

781
00:46:47.344 --> 00:46:50.144
It seems like it became small after it got wet. It feels uncomfortable.

782
00:46:51.543 --> 00:46:52.644
Let go.

783
00:46:54.684 --> 00:46:56.454
Don't you see that I look more uncomfortable?

784
00:46:56.554 --> 00:46:58.653
If you feel uncomfortable, take your tie off.

785
00:47:02.753 --> 00:47:03.923
Aren't you going to let go?

786
00:47:04.193 --> 00:47:05.653
Let go. Let it go.

787
00:47:11.293 --> 00:47:12.704
You should wear mine instead.

788
00:47:12.863 --> 00:47:14.534
I want to wear this.

789
00:47:33.124 --> 00:47:35.023
- What is that? - That looks so funny.

790
00:47:35.023 --> 00:47:36.354
Gosh.

791
00:47:36.724 --> 00:47:37.753
Look.

792
00:47:37.894 --> 00:47:39.363
Gosh, it's the best.

793
00:47:39.363 --> 00:47:40.963
Gosh.

794
00:47:41.293 --> 00:47:43.363
- Gosh. - That's so funny.

795
00:47:47.363 --> 00:47:50.633
(My love)

796
00:47:54.144 --> 00:47:56.673
It's so nice here, isn't it?

797
00:47:56.943 --> 00:47:58.613
It is. It's nice.

798
00:47:59.184 --> 00:48:00.213
Thank you.

799
00:48:00.344 --> 00:48:01.483
For what?

800
00:48:01.684 --> 00:48:02.784
For everything.

801
00:48:03.083 --> 00:48:06.324
If you hadn't found me, and I had taken a leave,

802
00:48:06.784 --> 00:48:08.423
I think I would have regretted it my whole life.

803
00:48:08.554 --> 00:48:10.954
I wouldn't have any memories to recall from the past.

804
00:48:11.124 --> 00:48:12.494
This is all going to be a memory in the future.

805
00:48:13.193 --> 00:48:14.923
I think I came to the right university.

806
00:48:16.264 --> 00:48:18.733
I'm trying to make a lot of good memories too.

807
00:48:19.063 --> 00:48:21.434
I want so many of them so that I can...

808
00:48:21.604 --> 00:48:23.974
recall them continuously when I grow older.

809
00:48:24.673 --> 00:48:26.804
- I want to be a part of that. - All right.

810
00:48:28.074 --> 00:48:30.644
What's this? Why are you leaving me out?

811
00:48:31.043 --> 00:48:32.983
I want to be a part of it. What is it?

812
00:48:32.983 --> 00:48:34.644
You already are.

813
00:48:36.713 --> 00:48:38.784
Why are you still here?

814
00:48:39.253 --> 00:48:41.684
If you're done getting fresh air, you should go home.

815
00:48:42.184 --> 00:48:43.994
Everyone else is fine with me being here.

816
00:48:44.494 --> 00:48:46.094
You're the only one who doesn't like it.

817
00:48:46.624 --> 00:48:47.724
It's six to one.

818
00:48:50.934 --> 00:48:52.333
Gosh, he's driving me crazy.

819
00:49:01.903 --> 00:49:03.543
Come closer!

820
00:49:04.773 --> 00:49:05.914
Why?

821
00:49:05.983 --> 00:49:07.744
You two make a great couple.

822
00:49:07.914 --> 00:49:09.554
Can't you just let them keep them?

823
00:49:09.713 --> 00:49:11.213
They look so nice in them.

824
00:49:11.383 --> 00:49:12.983
Yes, you can have these.

825
00:49:13.124 --> 00:49:14.324
You can have them.

826
00:49:14.454 --> 00:49:15.523
- I don't want it! - I don't want it!

827
00:49:16.923 --> 00:49:18.653
I think they like it.

828
00:49:20.094 --> 00:49:21.293
Gosh.

829
00:49:21.693 --> 00:49:22.963
Walk next to each other.

830
00:49:24.863 --> 00:49:25.934
Gosh.

831
00:49:29.003 --> 00:49:30.403
Hey, lovers!

832
00:49:31.934 --> 00:49:33.644
- How delicious. - Eat up.

833
00:49:37.543 --> 00:49:38.813
- It's fine. - Eat up.

834
00:49:42.014 --> 00:49:43.483
It's so poor.

835
00:49:43.813 --> 00:49:45.213
It doesn't have a head...

836
00:49:46.624 --> 00:49:48.023
nor a tail.

837
00:49:48.684 --> 00:49:50.324
Are you all right, shrimp?

838
00:49:54.863 --> 00:49:56.594
- Let's eat up all the poor shrimps. - Okay.

839
00:49:56.693 --> 00:49:58.133
Gosh.

840
00:50:05.844 --> 00:50:07.173
You can't do anything to this.

841
00:50:08.704 --> 00:50:11.344
Food.

842
00:50:11.344 --> 00:50:13.344
There's no food.

843
00:50:13.344 --> 00:50:15.313
Why would you say that? There's food in front of you.

844
00:50:15.313 --> 00:50:16.583
There's shrimp and peanut snacks.

845
00:50:16.784 --> 00:50:18.113
You should have them.

846
00:50:18.753 --> 00:50:20.624
Poor shrimp.

847
00:50:26.523 --> 00:50:28.863
I'm the poor one. Me. Me!

848
00:50:31.863 --> 00:50:33.934
Why do you always come in when I'm washing?

849
00:50:34.003 --> 00:50:35.104
What are you talking about?

850
00:50:35.104 --> 00:50:37.474
You come in when I'm trying to wash.

851
00:50:40.503 --> 00:50:41.874
You must be so happy.

852
00:50:42.543 --> 00:50:44.713
I'm not sure you realize people like that are handsome...

853
00:50:44.713 --> 00:50:46.644
but empty inside.

854
00:50:47.613 --> 00:50:50.113
He's Jung Nam Gil, the lecturer who earns a hundred thousand dollars.

855
00:50:50.113 --> 00:50:51.213
Don't you remember?

856
00:50:54.124 --> 00:50:55.184
Jung Nam Gil?

857
00:50:56.624 --> 00:50:58.253
Hey, look at that.

858
00:50:58.454 --> 00:50:59.793
He's incredible.

859
00:50:59.793 --> 00:51:02.494
A man who reads history to you, Jung Nam Gil.

860
00:51:03.193 --> 00:51:05.363
Hey, that's the guy...

861
00:51:05.394 --> 00:51:06.463
that liked me.

862
00:51:06.764 --> 00:51:07.963
Really?

863
00:51:08.664 --> 00:51:10.034
Believe what you will.

864
00:51:10.633 --> 00:51:12.133
It's true.

865
00:51:12.503 --> 00:51:15.144
He earns 60 million dollars a year.

866
00:51:15.144 --> 00:51:16.414
I envy him.

867
00:51:21.983 --> 00:51:24.554
Right. Jung Nam Gil. History Major.

868
00:51:25.213 --> 00:51:27.023
Gosh, Ma Jin Joo, you're smart.

869
00:51:27.354 --> 00:51:29.193
Is that why you flirted with him? Because he's rich?

870
00:51:33.124 --> 00:51:35.724
He liked me first.

871
00:51:35.894 --> 00:51:37.664
He doesn't lack anything,

872
00:51:37.664 --> 00:51:39.764
and he even has great taste.

873
00:51:39.764 --> 00:51:42.363
Right? My gosh.

874
00:51:46.173 --> 00:51:47.403
And what did you say?

875
00:51:48.173 --> 00:51:49.773
"Are you hitting on him because he's rich?"

876
00:51:49.773 --> 00:51:51.014
Speak for yourself.

877
00:51:51.014 --> 00:51:53.914
You shouldn't have spoken ill of Doctor Park.

878
00:51:53.914 --> 00:51:55.383
What's she saying?

879
00:51:56.983 --> 00:51:58.454
You two looked great together.

880
00:51:58.713 --> 00:52:00.454
A beautiful young man and a beautiful young woman.

881
00:52:05.253 --> 00:52:07.863
Hey, that's not the case.

882
00:52:08.994 --> 00:52:12.034
Gosh. What does she think of me?

883
00:52:13.333 --> 00:52:15.503
In your memories

884
00:52:15.604 --> 00:52:20.244
I want to become someone you long to see

885
00:52:27.313 --> 00:52:30.354
Why are you watching TV when you're on a trip?

886
00:52:31.354 --> 00:52:34.224
Why did you want to come to Gangneung of all places?

887
00:52:34.724 --> 00:52:36.224
There's a reason.

888
00:52:36.854 --> 00:52:38.224
Are you going somewhere?

889
00:52:38.224 --> 00:52:41.563
Yes. Right, do you know where Jin Joo is?

890
00:52:42.224 --> 00:52:43.233
No.

891
00:52:44.333 --> 00:52:46.704
Have you seen Jin Joo?

892
00:52:47.403 --> 00:52:50.333
Oh, she went out for a walk.

893
00:53:10.793 --> 00:53:11.793
What are you doing?

894
00:53:11.793 --> 00:53:13.463
I looked around the neighborhood.

895
00:53:15.894 --> 00:53:16.963
Why don't you take another look?

896
00:53:18.264 --> 00:53:19.664
I want to take a walk too.

897
00:53:25.104 --> 00:53:27.574
There were a lot of stars in the sky during this time.

898
00:53:28.374 --> 00:53:29.644
Is it because I'm in the countryside?

899
00:53:30.813 --> 00:53:31.844
Hey.

900
00:53:33.144 --> 00:53:35.284
Two days ago, I was a bit...

901
00:53:37.454 --> 00:53:38.914
"I don't have a mom. Mind your own business."

902
00:53:38.914 --> 00:53:39.923
Are you talking about that?

903
00:53:40.184 --> 00:53:41.284
When did I do that?

904
00:53:41.583 --> 00:53:42.824
I didn't say it like that.

905
00:53:43.923 --> 00:53:45.963
I thought you were all grown up because you're so tall,

906
00:53:45.963 --> 00:53:47.994
but you're still a rebellious teenager.

907
00:53:48.693 --> 00:53:50.264
I meant it when I told you to mind your own business.

908
00:53:51.164 --> 00:53:53.164
So what you said about not having a mom isn't true.

909
00:53:53.934 --> 00:53:56.204
Everyone has a mom.

910
00:53:56.204 --> 00:53:58.273
Whether she's halfway around the world or deceased,

911
00:53:58.273 --> 00:53:59.804
she's got to be somewhere.

912
00:54:00.344 --> 00:54:02.244
Do you think you're Park Hyeok Geo Se?

913
00:54:02.244 --> 00:54:03.414
The guy who was born from an egg?

914
00:54:03.874 --> 00:54:05.784
Everyone has their own story.

915
00:54:06.344 --> 00:54:07.514
Right.

916
00:54:08.514 --> 00:54:10.383
Every family has a story.

917
00:54:10.653 --> 00:54:12.954
You need to love her a lot while you can see her...

918
00:54:13.253 --> 00:54:14.883
and touch her.

919
00:54:33.503 --> 00:54:34.903
It's your loss later on.

920
00:54:37.273 --> 00:54:38.273
Wait.

921
00:54:38.974 --> 00:54:40.344
You're talking down to me again.

922
00:54:41.144 --> 00:54:42.383
And so is he.

923
00:54:43.713 --> 00:54:47.253
My goodness. This town is beautiful.

924
00:54:48.624 --> 00:54:50.293
Look over there.

925
00:54:50.293 --> 00:54:51.793
How beautiful.

926
00:55:01.764 --> 00:55:03.204
Hello, excuse me.

927
00:55:03.204 --> 00:55:04.304
Over there.

928
00:55:04.874 --> 00:55:06.974
Over there? Thank you.

929
00:55:13.244 --> 00:55:14.844
I think we came a bit too far.

930
00:55:14.844 --> 00:55:16.883
I think the road ended.

931
00:55:17.113 --> 00:55:18.113
You're right.

932
00:55:19.753 --> 00:55:20.753
Let's go back.

933
00:55:25.994 --> 00:55:27.023
Something's there.

934
00:55:27.523 --> 00:55:28.994
Stop it. You're scaring me.

935
00:56:01.363 --> 00:56:02.363
These are...

936
00:56:12.204 --> 00:56:13.403
They're fireflies.

937
00:56:15.813 --> 00:56:18.514
Right, it's their season.

938
00:56:23.713 --> 00:56:25.054
Wow, this is so beautiful.

939
00:56:56.813 --> 00:56:57.813
It's cold.

940
00:57:00.224 --> 00:57:01.354
But I'm cold too.

941
00:57:17.003 --> 00:57:19.344
I think it's around here somewhere.

942
00:57:22.104 --> 00:57:23.113
Oh, it's here.

943
00:57:46.034 --> 00:57:48.003
Right, do you know where Jin Joo is?

944
00:57:48.563 --> 00:57:49.574
No.

945
00:57:49.574 --> 00:57:51.633
When I call you later, bring her out, okay?

946
00:57:51.633 --> 00:57:52.874
You have to.

947
00:57:52.874 --> 00:57:53.974
Come on.

948
00:57:54.443 --> 00:57:56.744
Hello? Ban Do.

949
00:57:57.113 --> 00:57:59.914
Hey, why won't he say anything?

950
00:58:26.704 --> 00:58:28.474
Have you ever been to Gangneung before?

951
00:58:32.983 --> 00:58:33.983
I don't know.

952
00:58:34.483 --> 00:58:36.014
I don't remember.

953
00:59:18.023 --> 00:59:19.124
There was...

954
00:59:22.934 --> 00:59:25.394
once a time when my universe revolved around...

955
00:59:27.164 --> 00:59:28.534
only you.

956
00:59:43.284 --> 00:59:45.014
(Epilogue)

957
00:59:45.284 --> 00:59:46.653
Goodness.

958
00:59:47.383 --> 00:59:50.253
People say a thief who learned it late forgets about the sunrise.

959
00:59:50.394 --> 00:59:52.023
That's exactly this situation.

960
01:00:13.883 --> 01:00:14.883
Take your hand off.

961
01:00:15.813 --> 01:00:16.854
No, take your hand off.

962
01:00:17.854 --> 01:00:19.014
Come on, do it.

963
01:00:19.014 --> 01:00:20.153
You take your hand off.

964
01:01:39.304 --> 01:01:40.333
Gosh.

965
01:02:03.293 --> 01:02:06.324
This is why habits are scary, kid.

966
01:02:20.673 --> 01:02:21.943
Why you...

967
01:03:29.213 --> 01:03:32.213
(Go Back Couple)

968
01:03:32.213 --> 01:03:34.844
Jin Joo should meet someone nice this time and be happy.

969
01:03:34.983 --> 01:03:36.083
She's still young.

970
01:03:36.253 --> 01:03:39.054
Is Bo Reum a shaman? Did she put a spell?

971
01:03:39.054 --> 01:03:40.624
I'll protect her!

972
01:03:41.023 --> 01:03:44.394
Do you think Mom will be with us forever?

973
01:03:44.724 --> 01:03:46.224
Don't regret it later.

974
01:03:47.164 --> 01:03:49.733
Are you okay? Why doesn't your back get better ever?

975
01:03:50.633 --> 01:03:53.204
I heard it from the medical school students.

976
01:03:53.363 --> 01:03:57.074
They said he went after Jin Joo that night and harassed her.

977
01:03:57.773 --> 01:03:59.403
Not the earthquake records, but predictions.

978
01:03:59.903 --> 01:04:01.744
When will there be another earthquake in Seoul?
