<i>[This program is suitable
for viewers ages 15 and up.]</i>

3
00:00:16.974 --> 00:00:19.335
I'm not sure where to start.

4
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.289
I don't know what to say.

5
00:00:25.062 --> 00:00:29.248
No, I'll still tell you.

6
00:00:30.468 --> 00:00:32.111
Yes, I'll make it short.

7
00:00:35.675 --> 00:00:38.611
I met my wife 20 years ago.

8
00:00:40.105 --> 00:00:44.560
After I was discharged from the military,
a senior of mine set me up with a woman.

9
00:00:45.938 --> 00:00:48.255
I was 25 years old.

10
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.398
We got married after a year of dating.

11
00:00:53.398 --> 00:00:57.604
And we had a baby two months
after getting married.

12
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.721
That child was an angel.

13
00:01:06.034 --> 00:01:11.403
<i>I felt like she'd fly away with her
angel wings if I took my eyes off her.</i>

14
00:01:14.391 --> 00:01:16.748
<i>I was the happiest during that time.</i>

15
00:01:18.901 --> 00:01:22.755
<i>Na Hyun, my full moon...</i>

16
00:01:22.755 --> 00:01:25.996
<i>"How did I have such a beautiful baby?"</i>

17
00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:35.763
<i>But for a few days,
I couldn't look at her face.</i>

18
00:01:50.761 --> 00:01:52.240
My wife...

19
00:01:56.647 --> 00:01:58.754
got into a car accident.

20
00:02:16.118 --> 00:02:18.111
<i>May I have another glass of water?</i>

21
00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:31.407
Na Hyun didn't sleep
if I didn't watch over her.

22
00:02:36.815 --> 00:02:38.750
Dad.

23
00:02:39.624 --> 00:02:44.476
Don't go anywhere
until I fall asleep, okay?

24
00:02:47.382 --> 00:02:48.841
A second marriage?

25
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.269
Not at all.

26
00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:58.876
All I needed was Na Hyun.

27
00:03:01.232 --> 00:03:03.399
I didn't have any intention
to love anyone else.

28
00:03:22.318 --> 00:03:26.726
You scared me! Don't stare at me
like that! You look like a ghost!

29
00:03:26.726 --> 00:03:28.117
I'm sorry.

30
00:03:28.117 --> 00:03:31.335
What is this?
You scared the crap out of me.

31
00:03:33.381 --> 00:03:35.781
Na Hyun, I have something to tell you.

32
00:03:35.781 --> 00:03:38.108
Tell me tomorrow.

33
00:03:40.291 --> 00:03:42.160
I'm dating someone.

34
00:03:46.582 --> 00:03:48.849
What do you think about having a mother?

35
00:04:02.215 --> 00:04:04.899
I didn't ask her because I was curious.

36
00:04:07.208 --> 00:04:09.343
Because I already knew the answer.

37
00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.026
You're Na Hyun, huh?
It's nice to meet you.

38
00:04:48.235 --> 00:04:57.498
<i>[A man and a woman.]</i>

39
00:05:25.207 --> 00:05:27.937
Are you here? Please sit down.

40
00:06:07.875 --> 00:06:10.091
Did you enjoy Honfleur?

41
00:06:10.091 --> 00:06:12.077
- Yes.
- Yes.

42
00:06:12.077 --> 00:06:17.399
Thanks to your tip, I ate delicious food
and had a relaxing trip.

43
00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:19.358
Thank you very much.

44
00:06:19.358 --> 00:06:22.998
- Then sing us a song.
- Gosh, don't ask her to do that.

45
00:06:22.998 --> 00:06:26.252
- Should I? Should I sing a song?
- Yeah! Applause!

46
00:06:28.327 --> 00:06:32.349
But, I'm tone-deaf,
so my voice will ruin your vacation.

47
00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:35.039
I'll sing for you next time.

48
00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:37.166
When will that be?

49
00:06:37.166 --> 00:06:41.120
Deauville is 30 minutes from here.

50
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.099
Deauville is a beautiful, seaside city.

51
00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:47.308
- Another beach?
- But it's a different beach.

52
00:06:47.308 --> 00:06:50.130
If Honfleur is a beach
that inspires contemplation

53
00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.837
Deauville is a beach
that makes you fall in love.

54
00:06:53.837 --> 00:06:56.312
Love is great.

55
00:06:56.312 --> 00:06:58.697
Big Sis Guide, do you have a boyfriend?

56
00:06:58.697 --> 00:07:00.969
What do you think? Take a guess.

57
00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:03.106
If you don't have one,
I'll introduce you to someone.

58
00:07:03.106 --> 00:07:06.358
Really? I'd be thankful.

59
00:07:06.358 --> 00:07:10.279
What do you think about our elite?
He came on this trip alone.

60
00:07:13.562 --> 00:07:15.358
Yes...

61
00:07:15.358 --> 00:07:18.433
Deauville used to be
a small beach village

62
00:07:18.433 --> 00:07:24.303
but in 1861, Morny, the half-brother
of Napoleon III, developed the village.

63
00:07:24.303 --> 00:07:25.865
<i>He had one objective.</i>

64
00:07:25.865 --> 00:07:29.928
<i>He aimed to build the top vacation
spot for bourgeois in France.</i>

65
00:07:29.928 --> 00:07:33.526
- Why aren't you answering me?
- Gosh, seriously! Stop it!

66
00:07:33.526 --> 00:07:36.353
- She's not answering me.
- She doesn't have to.

67
00:07:36.353 --> 00:07:38.354
She should answer an elder's question.

68
00:07:38.354 --> 00:07:41.293
Why did you have to ask her
that question, though?

69
00:07:41.293 --> 00:07:43.000
She said she doesn't have a boyfriend.

70
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.697
She didn't say that.
She told you to take a guess.

71
00:07:45.697 --> 00:07:47.913
So I guessed that
she doesn't have a boyfriend.

72
00:07:47.913 --> 00:07:52.041
Everyone has a partner,
but our elite is alone.

73
00:07:52.041 --> 00:07:55.327
What did I do wrong?
Everyone's listening!

74
00:07:55.327 --> 00:07:57.137
They have their preferences.

75
00:07:57.137 --> 00:07:59.164
You shouldn't do that
in front of everyone...

76
00:07:59.164 --> 00:08:01.274
That's enough!

77
00:08:02.584 --> 00:08:06.005
- He's mad.
- You started it.

78
00:08:07.764 --> 00:08:10.139
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

79
00:08:10.139 --> 00:08:12.291
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

80
00:08:13.711 --> 00:08:16.760
Deauville is a high-class vacation spot

81
00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.942
that offers horseback riding, polo,
casinos, yachts, etcetera.

82
00:08:19.942 --> 00:08:22.334
You're able to enjoy both
rest and entertainment

83
00:08:22.334 --> 00:08:25.026
which is why many Europeans
enjoy coming here.

84
00:08:25.026 --> 00:08:30.043
Their traditions are still alive,
so many clubs have been built.

85
00:08:30.043 --> 00:08:34.791
<i>I'm sorry and thankful to her,
because she still smiled.</i>

86
00:08:35.658 --> 00:08:38.031
<i>It wasn't a situation
where you could smile.</i>

87
00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:10.084
Really?

88
00:09:10.084 --> 00:09:12.608
People often don't know
their own underwear size.

89
00:09:12.608 --> 00:09:16.626
You have to measure it precisely.
If you don't, it's uncomfortable.

90
00:09:17.699 --> 00:09:22.685
If you're not comfortable telling
your dad anything, talk to me, okay?

91
00:09:22.685 --> 00:09:24.706
I'm more uncomfortable with you, though.

92
00:09:34.412 --> 00:09:36.727
You should have given me
spending money instead.

93
00:09:37.383 --> 00:09:39.340
I put spending money in there too.

94
00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:41.829
I'll decline.

95
00:09:46.017 --> 00:09:48.799
<i>I might have fallen for her then.</i>

96
00:09:50.377 --> 00:09:55.292
No one introduced us.
We met because of work.

97
00:09:56.488 --> 00:09:59.088
I work at a forwarding company

98
00:09:59.088 --> 00:10:02.776
and she works in
clothing import and export.

99
00:10:05.878 --> 00:10:10.780
I made many mistakes
since the first time I we met.

100
00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:13.675
Didn't you say you're near
Seodaejeon Station?

101
00:10:14.581 --> 00:10:18.318
Seodaejeon Station is near
Seodaejeon Negeori Station

102
00:10:18.318 --> 00:10:20.613
but it's not the same place, right?

103
00:10:20.613 --> 00:10:23.854
I'm sorry, I'm just having
a hard time understanding.

104
00:10:24.467 --> 00:10:28.105
Pardon? Seodaejeon Negeori Bus Station?

105
00:10:29.358 --> 00:10:31.478
But that's not an intersection.

106
00:10:31.478 --> 00:10:35.641
Seodaejeon Negeori Bus Station
isn't where Seodaejeon Negeori is?

107
00:10:37.898 --> 00:10:40.667
<i>[Seodaejeon Negeori]</i>

108
00:11:01.844 --> 00:11:03.887
Yes, I just got off!

109
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:06.007
Yes.

110
00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:09.368
- To the right...
- Seodaejeon Station.

111
00:11:09.368 --> 00:11:12.223
- Yes, it's Seodaejeon Negeori.
- Yes, yes.

112
00:11:12.223 --> 00:11:13.924
- Behind me?
- Behind you.

113
00:11:15.614 --> 00:11:18.252
- Behind...
- Head Chief Jung!

114
00:11:21.435 --> 00:11:25.116
Hello, ma'am. I'm sorry I got lost.

115
00:11:25.116 --> 00:11:29.261
My car broke down on the way,
so I parked it.

116
00:11:29.261 --> 00:11:32.191
But I forgot my wallet in there
so I couldn't take a taxi.

117
00:11:32.191 --> 00:11:35.195
I managed to take the bus
with the change in my pockets.

118
00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:39.129
If you lend me some money
for my ride back, I'll pay you back.

119
00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.791
- Sure.
- Thank you.

120
00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.383
<i>I borrowed 30,000 won.</i>

121
00:11:47.041 --> 00:11:49.690
The unit price couldn't be negotiated,
so we didn't make a deal.

122
00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.579
But I went back there to pay her back.

123
00:11:53.579 --> 00:11:55.493
Not at Seodaejeon Negeori Station

124
00:11:55.493 --> 00:11:57.383
but at the intersection
of Seodaejeon Station.

125
00:11:57.383 --> 00:11:59.930
I could have wired it to her...

126
00:12:02.352 --> 00:12:05.593
But I wanted to buy her a meal
as a token of my appreciation.

127
00:12:07.113 --> 00:12:11.336
No, I went back there again
the next week.

128
00:12:11.336 --> 00:12:13.258
Why are you here again?

129
00:12:14.526 --> 00:12:18.030
- Because of the money I borrowed.
- You paid me back.

130
00:12:19.488 --> 00:12:21.084
I didn't pay you interest.

131
00:12:24.843 --> 00:12:29.599
<i>I paid her interest a few times,
but no matter how many times I paid her</i>

132
00:12:29.599 --> 00:12:31.588
<i>I felt like I was still in debt.</i>

133
00:12:32.233 --> 00:12:36.411
I feel like a loan shark.
It's as if you owe me endless interest.

134
00:12:36.411 --> 00:12:37.859
I know, right?

135
00:12:40.772 --> 00:12:42.492
<i>"I should stop."</i>

136
00:12:43.161 --> 00:12:45.945
"I should stop seeing her
before I like her too much."

137
00:12:49.329 --> 00:12:50.930
But it was hard to do.

138
00:12:52.698 --> 00:12:56.666
<i>The start and end of our relationships...</i>

139
00:12:59.366 --> 00:13:01.844
<i>have nothing to do with our will.</i>

140
00:13:31.839 --> 00:13:36.340
This is where the aristocrats
of Europe gathered.

141
00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:39.080
In the beginning of its development...

142
00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.459
Look at her.
There's something between them.

143
00:13:43.744 --> 00:13:47.367
- I know, you said they're dating.
- Not that.

144
00:13:47.367 --> 00:13:50.099
See? She won't make eye contact with him.

145
00:13:50.099 --> 00:13:52.489
They were whispering
to each other not long ago.

146
00:13:53.401 --> 00:13:55.689
How do you notice all of that?

147
00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.153
And there are many potted plants

148
00:13:59.153 --> 00:14:02.767
so it's a beach
"embroidered with flowers."

149
00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:10.776
Designer shopping can't be left out
of a luxurious vacation spot.

150
00:14:10.776 --> 00:14:14.199
The wooden villas
that I told you about earlier

151
00:14:14.199 --> 00:14:17.145
<i>has been changed into designer shops.</i>

152
00:14:17.145 --> 00:14:20.627
<i>A movie called "Coco Before Chanel"
came out in 2009.</i>

153
00:14:20.627 --> 00:14:23.378
That movie was shot here as well.

154
00:14:23.378 --> 00:14:27.390
That tells you that this place
is a symbol of luxury goods.

155
00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:30.241
- Let's go to our next destination.
- Aren't we going to look around?

156
00:14:30.241 --> 00:14:35.210
You'll have free time today and tomorrow,
so you can freely look around then.

157
00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:36.877
Shall we get going?

158
00:15:12.319 --> 00:15:14.746
It's me. You didn't answer my video call.

159
00:15:14.746 --> 00:15:17.523
Yeah, I'm still working.
I'm not home yet.

160
00:15:17.523 --> 00:15:19.758
Geez, aren't you overworking yourself?

161
00:15:19.758 --> 00:15:22.941
I should get everything done now so we
can see each other when you get back.

162
00:15:22.941 --> 00:15:25.530
<i>Wait three days. I'll be back soon.</i>

163
00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:27.618
Okay.

164
00:15:27.618 --> 00:15:30.393
But I'm pretty busy right now.

165
00:15:30.393 --> 00:15:34.147
I'm sorry. I just have one question.
Do you like black or brown?

166
00:15:34.147 --> 00:15:36.811
Don't think about buying me
anything, and hang up.

167
00:15:36.811 --> 00:15:38.727
I like red.

168
00:15:42.892 --> 00:15:44.352
Red?

169
00:15:47.704 --> 00:15:50.931
- When will he be back?
- In three days.

170
00:15:50.931 --> 00:15:54.117
- Time flies by.
- I know, right?

171
00:15:54.117 --> 00:15:56.579
I thought it'd feel like a lifetime.

172
00:15:58.373 --> 00:16:01.421
<i>I still haven't gotten her a proper gift.</i>

173
00:16:02.354 --> 00:16:06.379
<i>All men... want to buy a designer gift</i>

174
00:16:07.363 --> 00:16:09.373
<i>for their woman.</i>

175
00:16:12.652 --> 00:16:14.762
Am I taking too much of your time?

176
00:16:14.762 --> 00:16:17.554
No, please keep going.

177
00:16:17.554 --> 00:16:19.539
You are.

178
00:16:19.539 --> 00:16:24.228
It's not like we gathered
to hear your love story.

179
00:16:24.228 --> 00:16:29.039
As Na Hyun's homeroom teacher,
it's important to know her family life

180
00:16:29.039 --> 00:16:32.114
before taking disciplinary action.

181
00:16:33.756 --> 00:16:35.334
Principal.

182
00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:42.104
Do you talk to Na Hyun often?

183
00:16:43.151 --> 00:16:47.634
I try my best, but she doesn't
want to talk to me.

184
00:16:49.642 --> 00:16:52.121
- I'm home!
- Are you home?

185
00:16:52.121 --> 00:16:53.400
Did you have dinner?

186
00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:59.932
Did you eat dinner?

187
00:16:59.932 --> 00:17:02.523
Gosh, seriously.

188
00:17:24.547 --> 00:17:29.244
And does your potential wife
try to communicate with Na Hyun?

189
00:17:29.244 --> 00:17:31.055
I think she's better than me.

190
00:17:31.696 --> 00:17:33.626
Even if she's your daughter,
she's a girl.

191
00:17:33.626 --> 00:17:36.421
Why would she want to hear you pee?

192
00:17:36.421 --> 00:17:39.078
I developed this habit
when Na Hyun was a baby.

193
00:17:39.078 --> 00:17:43.545
I was worried that I wouldn't be able
to hear her cry if I closed the door.

194
00:17:43.545 --> 00:17:48.257
That's why I always kept the door open
when I went to the bathroom.

195
00:17:48.257 --> 00:17:50.758
It's hard to fix an old habit.

196
00:17:51.439 --> 00:17:53.389
It's not like she cries anymore.

197
00:17:53.389 --> 00:17:55.716
Did you tell Na Hyun?

198
00:17:57.309 --> 00:18:00.580
What's the use? She'll only understand
when she becomes a mother.

199
00:18:01.194 --> 00:18:03.523
I'll talk to her for you.

200
00:18:05.568 --> 00:18:07.607
You don't have to strain yourself.

201
00:18:07.607 --> 00:18:09.634
I'll be Na Hyun's mother soon.

202
00:18:09.634 --> 00:18:12.763
Mothers and daughters are the
closest friends in the whole world.

203
00:18:12.763 --> 00:18:15.786
Tell me everything about Na Hyun
that I don't know yet.

204
00:18:17.346 --> 00:18:19.346
I tried to tell her...

205
00:18:20.446 --> 00:18:22.723
but I didn't know much.

206
00:18:24.203 --> 00:18:28.900
She's my daughter,
but I really don't know.

207
00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:32.924
We've never watched a movie together
since she graduated elementary school.

208
00:18:32.924 --> 00:18:35.860
<i>Have you watched "Casino Royale"?</i>

209
00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:38.491
This is where they filmed the movie.

210
00:18:38.491 --> 00:18:41.864
You probably think of Cannes
when you think of French film festivals

211
00:18:41.864 --> 00:18:46.381
but Deauville could be a city that is
more closely related to French films.

212
00:18:46.381 --> 00:18:50.516
An American film festival has been
held here for the last 40 years.

213
00:18:50.516 --> 00:18:54.667
And they've been holding the Deauville
Asian Film Festival since 1999.

214
00:18:54.667 --> 00:18:58.303
It's the only festival that features
Asian films in all of Europe.

215
00:18:58.303 --> 00:19:02.737
I was wondering... are we
allowed to go to the casinos?

216
00:19:02.737 --> 00:19:07.401
Of course, you can.
But you must make a promise.

217
00:19:07.401 --> 00:19:12.920
You can spend 100,000 for fun, but you
mustn't spend more than that, okay?

218
00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:13.981
- Yes.
- Yes.

219
00:19:13.981 --> 00:19:16.535
- You have to promise.
- I know.

220
00:19:16.535 --> 00:19:18.346
Bring the money you intend to spend

221
00:19:18.346 --> 00:19:21.600
and leave your credit cards
in your room. Okay?

222
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.023
I got it.

223
00:19:23.023 --> 00:19:25.919
- And, Father?
- Yes?

224
00:19:25.919 --> 00:19:28.594
You can't wear hiking gear
to the casinos, okay?

225
00:19:28.594 --> 00:19:30.254
Why? This is expensive.

226
00:19:30.254 --> 00:19:34.755
I just want you to dress like
a handsome gentleman for the casinos.

227
00:19:35.484 --> 00:19:38.427
I do look like a gentleman
when I dress up. I will. I will.

228
00:19:38.427 --> 00:19:40.682
Then, let's head to our next destination.

229
00:19:40.682 --> 00:19:42.222
- Yes.
- Yes.

230
00:21:14.278 --> 00:21:17.172
Please meet here by 8 a.m.
after having breakfast.

231
00:21:17.172 --> 00:21:22.465
We will return to Paris in the evening,
so bring your luggage down.

232
00:21:22.465 --> 00:21:26.335
I want to say two last things.
First, be careful of the casinos.

233
00:21:26.335 --> 00:21:29.142
Don't do anything you'll regret, okay?

234
00:21:29.142 --> 00:21:32.553
And second, don't wear hiking gear, okay?

235
00:21:32.553 --> 00:21:35.517
I know. I'll dress like a gentleman.

236
00:21:35.517 --> 00:21:38.353
Thank you for your cooperation today.

237
00:21:38.353 --> 00:21:39.825
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

238
00:21:39.825 --> 00:21:42.547
Please call me if anything happens.

239
00:21:42.547 --> 00:21:45.972
I'm in the same hotel,
so you can use the interphone.

240
00:21:45.972 --> 00:21:49.456
- The elevators are that way.
- Yes.

241
00:22:02.584 --> 00:22:04.654
Geez, thank you.

242
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:02.311
<i>Hello?</i>

243
00:23:02.311 --> 00:23:04.709
It's me, San Ma Ru.

244
00:23:05.763 --> 00:23:08.200
Hello, is there a problem?

245
00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:12.258
No. I just want to talk.

246
00:23:12.258 --> 00:23:13.861
About what?

247
00:23:15.343 --> 00:23:17.113
Would you like to grab a beer?

248
00:23:17.113 --> 00:23:19.921
I'm sorry. I have other plans.

249
00:23:19.921 --> 00:23:22.734
Rest well, and I'll see you tomorrow.

250
00:24:09.657 --> 00:24:12.016
A casino? Let's just go shopping.

251
00:24:12.016 --> 00:24:14.023
Geez, let's go to a casino first.

252
00:24:14.023 --> 00:24:17.221
But they're open all night.
The designer shops close at 9.

253
00:24:17.221 --> 00:24:20.286
- You can shop tomorrow.
- I'm going to shop tomorrow too.

254
00:24:20.286 --> 00:24:22.940
- Can you afford designer goods?
- I have my eye on something.

255
00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:26.209
A wallet that costs 1.2 million won
in Seoul costs 700,000 won here.

256
00:24:26.209 --> 00:24:28.843
A wallet? I thought
you wanted a shoulder bag.

257
00:24:28.843 --> 00:24:31.815
How could I afford that?
They cost over two million won.

258
00:24:31.815 --> 00:24:34.353
See? Money's the problem.

259
00:24:34.353 --> 00:24:35.959
Think about it.

260
00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:39.910
<i>What you want to buy is too expensive.</i>

261
00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:42.565
<i>But it's not satisfying enough
to only buy what you can afford.</i>

262
00:24:42.565 --> 00:24:45.282
<i>If you only browse, your heart aches.</i>

263
00:24:45.282 --> 00:24:47.815
How meaningless is that?

264
00:24:47.815 --> 00:24:50.859
But imagine if we went to a casino...

265
00:24:50.859 --> 00:24:53.411
and hit the jackpot.

266
00:24:54.366 --> 00:24:55.568
Yes!

267
00:24:58.613 --> 00:25:01.372
People hit the jackpot
at least once in their lives.

268
00:25:02.028 --> 00:25:05.075
Then, what do you think will happen?

269
00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:19.728
Let's go to a casino first.
Bring your money.

270
00:25:20.994 --> 00:25:22.515
I have it. Let's go.

271
00:25:24.395 --> 00:25:26.728
I don't want to.

272
00:25:26.728 --> 00:25:29.208
We should visit a casino
if we're in France.

273
00:25:29.208 --> 00:25:33.487
You never wanted to go anywhere
before. What's gotten into you today?

274
00:25:33.487 --> 00:25:36.798
We'll only go once
in our lifetime. Let's go.

275
00:25:36.798 --> 00:25:39.258
That time when customers
came and played Go-stop

276
00:25:39.258 --> 00:25:43.115
people next door reported it, so we lost
our business license. Did you forget?

277
00:25:43.115 --> 00:25:45.921
I get goosebumps
when I think about Go-stop!

278
00:25:45.921 --> 00:25:49.988
People don't play Go-stop in
French casinos. Get up. Come out.

279
00:25:52.969 --> 00:25:54.965
Are you going dressed like that?

280
00:25:58.269 --> 00:25:59.782
Gosh.

281
00:26:09.007 --> 00:26:11.484
Don't drink like that.

282
00:26:12.212 --> 00:26:14.533
- Aren't you drinking?
- I don't like beer.

283
00:26:14.533 --> 00:26:15.673
Really?

284
00:26:19.183 --> 00:26:22.757
- Do you drink?
- Gosh, you're so annoying.

285
00:26:22.757 --> 00:26:24.547
You taught me how to drink.

286
00:26:24.547 --> 00:26:28.978
You can drink beer with me,
but don't drink anywhere else.

287
00:26:28.978 --> 00:26:32.219
- You're underage.
- I got it, Head Chief Jung.

288
00:26:32.219 --> 00:26:35.055
- And who did you watch that movie with?
- Which movie?

289
00:26:35.055 --> 00:26:39.913
There a movie that was a hit in Korea.
Have you watched "Mad Max"?

290
00:26:39.913 --> 00:26:42.873
- Yes, I have.
- With whom?

291
00:26:42.873 --> 00:26:44.661
Mind your own business.

292
00:26:44.661 --> 00:26:48.200
How can I mind my own business?
That movie is rated R.

293
00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.565
What? It's PG-15.

294
00:26:50.565 --> 00:26:54.789
Yeah right. How can such a racy
and violent movie be PG-15?

295
00:26:54.789 --> 00:26:58.024
- Then bet 10,000 won on it.
- Just you wait.

296
00:26:58.821 --> 00:27:02.355
10,000 won isn't enough.
100 euros. 140,000 won.

297
00:27:02.355 --> 00:27:05.077
- Deal.
- The internet is highly developed

298
00:27:05.077 --> 00:27:09.384
so people can't lie anymore.
PG-15, my ass.

299
00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:27.794
I love you.

300
00:27:29.337 --> 00:27:31.892
But who did you watch it with?

301
00:27:34.459 --> 00:27:36.057
You watched it with that woman, right?

302
00:27:39.853 --> 00:27:42.873
You date around just fine
without me knowing.

303
00:27:48.969 --> 00:27:53.419
<i>We always watched movies together
when Na Hyun was young.</i>

304
00:27:54.351 --> 00:27:56.789
I looked at the rating
as soon as a movie came out.

305
00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:01.507
"It's PG-12. It's PG 15."

306
00:28:01.507 --> 00:28:04.283
"I can watch it with her."

307
00:28:04.283 --> 00:28:08.209
As she grew up, we were able to
watch more movies together.

308
00:28:09.932 --> 00:28:11.942
But she doesn't want to anymore.

309
00:28:13.623 --> 00:28:14.943
Did you know?

310
00:28:15.817 --> 00:28:19.577
People don't watch movies together
when they can't communicate.

311
00:28:19.577 --> 00:28:23.496
- You can stop talking about that.
- This is important, though.

312
00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:28.139
Na Hyun's dream was to
become a movie director.

313
00:28:28.139 --> 00:28:31.335
That's why she wanted to create a film
that would resonate with kids her age.

314
00:28:31.335 --> 00:28:34.426
"Film." A film?

315
00:28:34.426 --> 00:28:37.276
Did you even watch what she made?

316
00:28:39.056 --> 00:28:41.510
It's too dirty to even talk about.

317
00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:44.970
But I'm sure Na Hyun wanted to
say something else...

318
00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:47.373
Talking about it is dirty.

319
00:28:47.373 --> 00:28:50.700
Erotic films are less dirty
than what she made.

320
00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:54.305
- I'll apologize on her behalf.
- That's a given.

321
00:28:54.305 --> 00:28:57.381
But I can't accept it from my standpoint.

322
00:29:03.298 --> 00:29:04.604
I...

323
00:29:08.899 --> 00:29:11.142
All of my daughter's faults...

324
00:29:11.998 --> 00:29:14.087
are also my faults.

325
00:29:15.504 --> 00:29:17.941
Because Na Hyun grew up watching me.

326
00:29:27.767 --> 00:29:31.544
- What are you looking at?
- Should we play the truth game?

327
00:29:31.544 --> 00:29:33.613
I don't want to. It's boring.

328
00:29:33.613 --> 00:29:35.334
What do you think about me
getting married?

329
00:29:35.334 --> 00:29:36.997
I said I don't care.

330
00:29:36.997 --> 00:29:39.770
- Do you hate it?
- I said I don't care.

331
00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:41.749
How can you not care about your family?

332
00:29:41.749 --> 00:29:44.580
If I hate it,
will you cancel the marriage?

333
00:29:46.515 --> 00:29:49.113
- Probably.
- That's what I hate.

334
00:29:49.113 --> 00:29:51.836
I want to be me,
and I want you to be you.

335
00:29:51.836 --> 00:29:54.750
Rather than trying not to do
what the other person hates

336
00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:58.188
I'd prefer it if we both
did what we want.

337
00:30:05.976 --> 00:30:07.496
What about school?

338
00:30:08.568 --> 00:30:12.111
- You see...
- Don't be a coward because of me.

339
00:30:12.111 --> 00:30:14.198
I don't want to be held back
because of you either.

340
00:30:14.198 --> 00:30:16.847
- I'm not a coward.
- You are.

341
00:30:18.315 --> 00:30:20.785
I'm brave, you know.

342
00:30:20.785 --> 00:30:23.151
You know I was in
the special forces, right?

343
00:30:23.815 --> 00:30:27.036
I was at the DMZ for a secret mission.

344
00:30:27.036 --> 00:30:29.692
Don't talk about the military.
I'm sick of it.

345
00:30:29.692 --> 00:30:31.615
Just listen to me.

346
00:30:31.615 --> 00:30:34.575
The DMZ is above the MDL.

347
00:30:34.575 --> 00:30:38.371
At night, there was an eerie vibe.

348
00:30:38.371 --> 00:30:41.823
And all of a sudden,
something popped up in front of me.

349
00:30:41.823 --> 00:30:45.468
So I pointed a gun toward it.
But it still...

350
00:30:45.468 --> 00:30:48.583
crept up toward me.

351
00:30:49.882 --> 00:30:51.797
I looked at it...

352
00:30:52.969 --> 00:30:55.843
- and it was a tiger.
- Gosh, you're a liar.

353
00:30:55.843 --> 00:31:00.181
It's true. It was as big as...

354
00:31:00.181 --> 00:31:01.942
this table.

355
00:31:02.518 --> 00:31:06.892
But that punk cowered for a moment.

356
00:31:06.892 --> 00:31:10.353
And then it flew up into the air
and jumped me.

357
00:31:10.353 --> 00:31:12.498
- Really?
- Really.

358
00:31:12.498 --> 00:31:15.622
- What about your gun?
- I had no time to shoot.

359
00:31:15.622 --> 00:31:17.757
It was already jumping toward me.

360
00:31:17.757 --> 00:31:18.941
And then?

361
00:31:18.941 --> 00:31:22.788
So I grabbed the tiger's neck
on a whim and yelled at it.

362
00:31:22.788 --> 00:31:25.149
"You son of a bitch."

363
00:31:25.149 --> 00:31:28.257
- And then...
- Keep going.

364
00:31:32.734 --> 00:31:35.930
He said, "I'm not a dog."

365
00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:38.051
It's an old story.

366
00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:43.220
- Cheers.
- I said I don't like beer.

367
00:31:44.314 --> 00:31:45.610
Really?

368
00:31:46.663 --> 00:31:48.305
Excuse me.

369
00:33:36.329 --> 00:33:42.793
<font color="#80ffff">[DF Ver] E09 The Package</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

370
00:35:36.964 --> 00:35:39.002
Hey, you're heavy.

371
00:35:39.002 --> 00:35:41.082
- Then exercise.
- What about school?

372
00:35:41.082 --> 00:35:42.910
I played hooky.

373
00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:45.750
Geez, way to be a good teacher.

374
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:49.067
Thanks for the compliment.
What about So So?

375
00:35:49.067 --> 00:35:50.868
I found her.

376
00:35:52.201 --> 00:35:54.683
- She bought me these clothes.
- Why did you come back alone?

377
00:35:54.683 --> 00:35:57.375
- She bought me these shoes too.
- Is she doing well?

378
00:35:57.375 --> 00:35:59.399
And she bought me this tie too.

379
00:36:01.067 --> 00:36:03.562
Did she? My groom looks so handsome.

380
00:36:03.562 --> 00:36:05.803
What do you want to eat?

381
00:36:05.803 --> 00:36:09.506
- Food with lots of seasoning.
- That's my specialty.

382
00:36:09.506 --> 00:36:11.145
Let's go. I'll make you food.

383
00:36:16.752 --> 00:36:19.384
Wow, your shoulders are more broad now.

384
00:36:19.384 --> 00:36:22.384
- Don't you feel safe?
- Of course.

385
00:36:23.375 --> 00:36:26.406
Is So So still pretty as always?
Is she eating properly?

386
00:36:26.406 --> 00:36:27.982
How is she?

387
00:36:28.645 --> 00:36:32.685
Big Sis... turned into a French woman.

388
00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:48.372
You look beautiful.

389
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.406
Let's talk.

390
00:37:06.587 --> 00:37:09.799
- Let's talk.
- I don't want to listen.

391
00:37:09.799 --> 00:37:11.310
I'm sorry.

392
00:37:13.765 --> 00:37:16.055
You shouldn't be that mad about this.

393
00:37:16.055 --> 00:37:19.136
I wore clothes and shoes
that I never wear

394
00:37:19.136 --> 00:37:21.352
to watch a show that was too expensive.

395
00:37:21.352 --> 00:37:25.799
I treated myself for once
in my life today. Don't ruin it.

396
00:37:27.417 --> 00:37:31.388
I'm not enjoying myself here.
I'm not just fooling around with you

397
00:37:31.388 --> 00:37:34.335
after breaking up with
my girlfriend during this vacation.

398
00:37:34.335 --> 00:37:37.660
That's funny. How could you
say that in this situation?

399
00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:41.332
Just listen. I'm going to say it
even if I seem like a loser.

400
00:37:41.332 --> 00:37:44.681
To me, you're not just
someone I can pass by.

401
00:37:44.681 --> 00:37:47.859
I was hoping you felt
the same way about me.

402
00:37:47.859 --> 00:37:51.239
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying I don't want to be

403
00:37:51.239 --> 00:37:53.169
one of many men you're seeing.

404
00:37:54.399 --> 00:37:56.743
How can you be so shameless?

405
00:37:56.743 --> 00:38:00.482
Am I not allowed? I like you.

406
00:38:00.482 --> 00:38:05.562
Can't I express my anger after seeing
you in a love quarrel with other men?

407
00:38:05.562 --> 00:38:09.634
Hold on. Can you explain
so I can understand?

408
00:38:09.634 --> 00:38:12.218
What love quarrel, and which men?

409
00:38:12.218 --> 00:38:14.892
Those men you were with in Honfleur.

410
00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.942
You're driving me crazy.

411
00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:27.009
Didier and Allan?

412
00:38:27.009 --> 00:38:29.861
Those friends are lovers.

413
00:38:29.861 --> 00:38:32.495
I know. I know that they're your lovers.

414
00:38:32.495 --> 00:38:36.468
No, Didier and Allan are lovers.

415
00:38:40.611 --> 00:38:42.694
But they're both men.

416
00:38:42.694 --> 00:38:44.178
That's right.

417
00:38:44.178 --> 00:38:48.372
They're engaged, but they were
about to call it off, so I tried to...

418
00:38:49.131 --> 00:38:52.355
Wait, what were you thinking...

419
00:38:53.189 --> 00:38:56.948
Did I seem like someone
who'd do that with two men...

420
00:38:56.948 --> 00:39:00.754
Look here, San Ma Ru! Is that
the kind of person you take me for?

421
00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:04.591
If they're lovers,
then what are they to you?

422
00:39:04.591 --> 00:39:07.910
Don't you remember?
How did I introduce them to you?

423
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:11.160
- As your boyfriends.
- When did I do that?

424
00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:13.622
Say hello. This is my friend, Didier.

425
00:39:13.622 --> 00:39:15.698
I clearly said they were friends.

426
00:39:15.698 --> 00:39:18.509
Say hello. This is my friend, Allan.

427
00:39:18.509 --> 00:39:20.248
Don't you know what
it means to be friends?

428
00:39:20.248 --> 00:39:23.504
Are all male friends boyfriends?

429
00:39:29.225 --> 00:39:32.710
Then... are you just friends?

430
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:36.142
Not just friends, but my best...

431
00:39:37.426 --> 00:39:39.877
- Let's stop.
- I'm sorry.

432
00:39:39.877 --> 00:39:42.776
- You don't have to apologize.
- I'm really sorry.

433
00:39:44.439 --> 00:39:48.194
I didn't know that,
and thought I was a nobody to you.

434
00:39:48.194 --> 00:39:53.524
San Ma Ru, you have
the qualities that I hate the most.

435
00:39:53.524 --> 00:39:57.361
You misunderstand, hurt,
and think however you want.

436
00:39:57.361 --> 00:39:59.007
After expecting
the other person to see that

437
00:39:59.007 --> 00:40:01.216
you just form your own conclusion.

438
00:40:01.216 --> 00:40:03.227
And after finding out
it was a misunderstanding

439
00:40:03.227 --> 00:40:07.797
you still want the other person
to understand you and comfort you.

440
00:40:07.797 --> 00:40:09.602
And secondly...

441
00:40:23.718 --> 00:40:25.386
I don't even want to say it.

442
00:40:27.214 --> 00:40:28.973
Is that why you threw away the shoes?

443
00:40:28.973 --> 00:40:33.078
I bought another pair in a bigger size
just in case they didn't fit.

444
00:40:35.517 --> 00:40:38.069
I bought another pair, just in case.

445
00:40:39.388 --> 00:40:41.511
I want to buy both.

446
00:40:41.511 --> 00:40:42.739
Okay.

447
00:40:46.671 --> 00:40:48.212
<i>I tried to throw them away...</i>

448
00:40:50.134 --> 00:40:52.489
<i>- but I couldn't.</i>
- Geez, seriously.

449
00:41:04.451 --> 00:41:07.977
I'm sorry for making you
wear shoes that didn't fit.

450
00:41:08.671 --> 00:41:13.593
I knew your feet were pretty,
but I didn't know their size.

451
00:41:15.431 --> 00:41:18.446
- I think you should follow him.
- No, that's okay.

452
00:41:18.446 --> 00:41:21.107
Follow him. It seems like
he likes you a lot.

453
00:41:21.107 --> 00:41:23.118
Really? Does it seem that way?

454
00:41:23.118 --> 00:41:26.256
Trust me. I know what men are
thinking by the look in their eyes.

455
00:41:36.109 --> 00:41:39.031
So So, are you crying?

456
00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:47.143
- What's wrong?
- I'm embarrassed.

457
00:41:47.143 --> 00:41:48.794
About what?

458
00:41:48.794 --> 00:41:52.267
I misunderstood,
imagined the wrong scenario

459
00:41:52.267 --> 00:41:54.529
and made a conclusion
without knowing the facts.

460
00:41:55.968 --> 00:41:57.893
I don't know what you're talking about.

461
00:41:59.332 --> 00:42:00.761
Get up.

462
00:42:04.011 --> 00:42:05.672
Why are you acting this way?

463
00:42:07.212 --> 00:42:08.506
Look at me.

464
00:42:09.370 --> 00:42:11.341
Let me look at your face.

465
00:42:14.997 --> 00:42:16.364
Look at me.

466
00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:19.131
What's the matter?

467
00:42:20.372 --> 00:42:21.803
What...

468
00:42:40.473 --> 00:42:42.960
How impressive.

469
00:42:43.616 --> 00:42:46.593
How could you lose
100,000 won in an instant?

470
00:42:46.593 --> 00:42:50.448
We hardly make profits after selling
chicken. But 100,000 won?

471
00:42:50.448 --> 00:42:52.372
I wasn't the only one who lost.

472
00:42:52.372 --> 00:42:54.587
At least I was close.

473
00:42:54.587 --> 00:42:57.785
I almost won too.

474
00:42:58.995 --> 00:43:01.312
It just that it didn't
work out in the end.

475
00:43:01.312 --> 00:43:05.274
If it works out in the end, is that
gambling? It never works out.

476
00:43:06.122 --> 00:43:07.529
Stop it.

477
00:43:09.009 --> 00:43:11.033
At least we had a fun time.

478
00:43:11.033 --> 00:43:14.363
Was it fun to lose money?

479
00:43:14.363 --> 00:43:17.064
It was the first time we've done that.

480
00:43:17.064 --> 00:43:22.645
It was all shiny with lights
flashing everywhere.

481
00:43:22.645 --> 00:43:24.524
That was unbelievably fun.

482
00:43:24.524 --> 00:43:28.232
How did I live without knowing
how fun that is?

483
00:43:34.422 --> 00:43:37.160
- Go.
- Where?

484
00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:40.127
You said it was fun. Play another round.

485
00:43:41.069 --> 00:43:44.910
- Really?
- Follow me.

486
00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:46.535
I'm okay, though.

487
00:43:48.281 --> 00:43:50.433
Then should I play
30,000 won worth of games?

488
00:43:50.433 --> 00:43:52.955
Are you going in your hiking outfit?

489
00:44:19.835 --> 00:44:22.098
- Is it locked?
- Yeah.

490
00:44:22.098 --> 00:44:23.518
Are you sure?

491
00:44:25.834 --> 00:44:31.147
In movies, people usually chase down
and kill people who win money.

492
00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:34.830
It's locked.

493
00:44:41.256 --> 00:44:43.647
18 million won!

494
00:45:14.535 --> 00:45:16.812
- Are we trading it in tomorrow?
- Of course.

495
00:45:16.812 --> 00:45:19.138
It's safer in broad daylight.

496
00:45:20.718 --> 00:45:23.598
Let's count it and see
exactly how much we have.

497
00:45:35.303 --> 00:45:37.533
How much is 1,420 euros?

498
00:45:38.388 --> 00:45:41.107
Isn't it almost 19 million won?

499
00:45:47.533 --> 00:45:48.928
This is strange.

500
00:45:49.495 --> 00:45:50.656
Why?

501
00:45:50.656 --> 00:45:55.076
1, 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000,
100,000, 1,000,000...

502
00:45:57.725 --> 00:45:59.093
Give it to me.

503
00:46:00.622 --> 00:46:06.460
1, 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000,
100,000, 1,000,000...

504
00:46:15.192 --> 00:46:16.756
Wait.

505
00:46:18.823 --> 00:46:21.051
It's 1.8 million won, right?

506
00:46:24.087 --> 00:46:28.495
1, 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000...

507
00:46:28.495 --> 00:46:30.038
100,000...

508
00:46:30.696 --> 00:46:32.122
1,000,000.

509
00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:10.698
Hey, we still won almost two million won.

510
00:47:10.698 --> 00:47:12.921
How great is that, right?

511
00:47:12.921 --> 00:47:15.629
You're right. I'm so happy.

512
00:47:19.038 --> 00:47:23.024
- 1, 10, 100, 1,000...
- Hey, stop it.

513
00:47:25.701 --> 00:47:28.968
Hey, buy that bag you want
tomorrow. That two million won bag.

514
00:47:28.968 --> 00:47:31.801
That's okay. I didn't win this by myself.

515
00:47:31.801 --> 00:47:34.654
Why not? You won it with your money.

516
00:47:35.714 --> 00:47:40.120
If this is 2 million won here,
isn't it over 2.5 million won in Korea?

517
00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:43.944
It's probably more than 2.67 million won.

518
00:47:44.546 --> 00:47:48.953
Then that means I'm making
670,000 won without doing anything.

519
00:47:48.953 --> 00:47:51.254
It is a total win.

520
00:47:51.254 --> 00:47:54.875
And we should spend
gambling money right away.

521
00:47:55.428 --> 00:47:58.160
Can you buy anything
with two million won?

522
00:47:59.129 --> 00:48:00.988
What would I buy?

523
00:48:00.988 --> 00:48:03.656
I'll look it up, though.

524
00:48:12.274 --> 00:48:14.326
Let's trade it in.

525
00:48:14.326 --> 00:48:16.939
No one will try to kill us over that.

526
00:48:19.348 --> 00:48:20.707
Yeah.

527
00:48:29.035 --> 00:48:31.468
Geez, look at you.

528
00:48:33.314 --> 00:48:35.785
You sure have a lot of guts.

529
00:48:35.785 --> 00:48:38.589
If you were born as a man,
it would have been over.

530
00:48:39.937 --> 00:48:42.718
Can you drink beer after
losing so much money?

531
00:48:42.718 --> 00:48:45.609
Why did you convince me to go there?

532
00:48:45.609 --> 00:48:49.207
If you ask me to go there again,
I'm going back to Seoul!

533
00:48:54.453 --> 00:48:56.591
Geez, look at you.

534
00:49:04.605 --> 00:49:08.971
I didn't know. I thought it was because
the shoes were small and I got mad.

535
00:49:08.971 --> 00:49:12.212
"Wow, she has a bad temper."

536
00:49:12.212 --> 00:49:13.884
That's what I thought.

537
00:49:14.739 --> 00:49:16.962
I wasn't going to talk to you again

538
00:49:16.962 --> 00:49:21.022
but after seeing the bandage
on your ankle, I felt sorry.

539
00:49:24.527 --> 00:49:25.897
So So?

540
00:49:26.486 --> 00:49:29.714
- Don't call me.
- Look at me.

541
00:49:29.714 --> 00:49:31.567
I'm embarrassed.

542
00:49:46.334 --> 00:49:51.230
I wasn't prepared when you showed up.

543
00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:53.111
All of a sudden.

544
00:49:54.564 --> 00:50:00.163
I must have tried to run away
as soon as I found a flaw.

545
00:50:01.332 --> 00:50:03.593
That way, I wouldn't get hurt.

546
00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:09.765
I was really happy
when you gave me those shoes.

547
00:50:10.859 --> 00:50:14.763
You didn't know my size,
so you must have contemplated

548
00:50:14.763 --> 00:50:16.846
about which size would fit.

549
00:50:19.218 --> 00:50:24.290
<i>I was thankful and admired
the time you spent for me.</i>

550
00:50:25.721 --> 00:50:30.517
But I found out you had
two pairs of the same shoes.

551
00:50:34.218 --> 00:50:36.149
"They must be for his girlfriend."

552
00:50:46.026 --> 00:50:47.799
We left each other.

553
00:50:48.727 --> 00:50:53.167
That friend left me, and I left her.

554
00:50:54.321 --> 00:50:56.810
I'll meet her when I go back to work

555
00:50:56.810 --> 00:51:01.966
but there won't be time to be
sad or hurt about our breakup.

556
00:51:01.966 --> 00:51:07.163
Because she'll have to harass me
on the company's behalf.

557
00:51:07.163 --> 00:51:09.390
Is she your superior at work?

558
00:51:12.337 --> 00:51:17.556
Anyway, it's unfortunate that
this happened in our department.

559
00:51:18.419 --> 00:51:20.404
You can take care of the rest.

560
00:51:20.404 --> 00:51:21.910
Yes, Head Chief.

561
00:51:23.379 --> 00:51:25.504
As you all know, San Ma Ru is on standby

562
00:51:25.504 --> 00:51:30.770
for absence without leave,
regulation violation, and duty neglect.

563
00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:34.111
And regarding matters
involving Ma Ru... Deputy Oh.

564
00:51:34.111 --> 00:51:38.232
- Yes?
- Take care of it

565
00:51:38.232 --> 00:51:40.821
and clean off his desk and computer.

566
00:51:41.426 --> 00:51:45.076
- I got it.
- At a time like this, work together

567
00:51:45.076 --> 00:51:49.024
and do a good job
so Head Chief can be at ease.

568
00:51:49.024 --> 00:51:50.549
Get back to work.

569
00:52:01.227 --> 00:52:03.114
- Chief Im.
- Yes?

570
00:52:03.114 --> 00:52:06.288
Don't let your guard down
because you found the file.

571
00:52:06.288 --> 00:52:08.174
It's important to
pay attention to detail.

572
00:52:08.174 --> 00:52:10.605
Don't worry. I'm taking care of it.

573
00:52:10.605 --> 00:52:13.772
Did you take care of the form
for the shipment to Africa?

574
00:52:13.772 --> 00:52:17.866
Their head chief is on leave
at the moment, so we'll have to wait.

575
00:52:17.866 --> 00:52:20.607
Hey, act like the boss.

576
00:52:20.607 --> 00:52:23.759
Can you really call him a head chief
if he's from that tiny company?

577
00:52:24.439 --> 00:52:26.636
Tell them I want to talk to their boss.

578
00:52:59.602 --> 00:53:01.127
Couple cacti.

579
00:53:01.863 --> 00:53:04.393
- Put it in front of your monitor.
- Okay.

580
00:53:04.393 --> 00:53:06.000
How pretty.

581
00:53:16.352 --> 00:53:18.968
You shouldn't throw that away.

582
00:53:18.968 --> 00:53:21.328
Ma Ru cherished it a lot.

583
00:53:24.317 --> 00:53:27.267
- Can you clean it up for me?
- Yes, Deputy Oh.

584
00:53:50.303 --> 00:53:53.736
I feel sad when I hear stories like that.

585
00:53:53.736 --> 00:53:57.158
Tangled relationships
are always full of painful wounds.

586
00:53:57.158 --> 00:54:02.285
But people still live together because
they know loneliness is the scariest.

587
00:54:07.042 --> 00:54:09.504
Isn't this beach beautiful?

588
00:54:11.189 --> 00:54:14.841
It really is, although I can't see it.

589
00:54:17.417 --> 00:54:21.180
"A Man and a Woman"
was filmed at this beach.

590
00:54:22.343 --> 00:54:25.143
<i>A woman lost her husband to an accident.</i>

591
00:54:25.803 --> 00:54:28.495
<i>And a man lost her wife to suicide.</i>

592
00:54:28.495 --> 00:54:31.669
<i>The hurt man and the hurt woman met</i>

593
00:54:31.669 --> 00:54:36.330
<i>loved, broke up, and then loved again.</i>

594
00:54:40.303 --> 00:54:43.821
- It's a happy ending.
- It is a movie, after all.

595
00:54:45.453 --> 00:54:49.897
Do you think there
are happy endings in love?

596
00:54:49.897 --> 00:54:54.218
There are. If you really love
each other, good times remain

597
00:54:54.218 --> 00:54:56.819
no matter what happens.

598
00:54:56.819 --> 00:54:58.988
Isn't it normal
for those times to remain?

599
00:54:58.988 --> 00:55:02.305
If those times don't remain,
that's real pain.

600
00:55:04.721 --> 00:55:06.448
Let's go for a walk.

601
00:55:23.701 --> 00:55:25.658
Why didn't you answer me yesterday?

602
00:55:26.406 --> 00:55:30.145
- About what?
- I asked you a question during the game.

603
00:55:30.145 --> 00:55:32.796
Why do you think I came on this trip?

604
00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:37.718
Because you love me?

605
00:55:37.718 --> 00:55:40.018
You're so easy.

606
00:55:40.821 --> 00:55:44.825
Why does it matter if we love each other?

607
00:55:47.745 --> 00:55:52.084
If you have something to say, say it now.
If it's not about school, I'll listen.

608
00:55:52.953 --> 00:55:54.756
You can't talk about that woman either.

609
00:56:00.939 --> 00:56:02.701
Then I don't have anything to say.

610
00:56:04.913 --> 00:56:07.002
Geez, isn't it cold?

611
00:56:07.714 --> 00:56:09.540
Don't do that.

612
00:56:12.024 --> 00:56:14.518
<i>I had so many things I wanted to say...</i>

613
00:56:17.109 --> 00:56:19.084
but I should stop now.

614
00:56:20.636 --> 00:56:26.189
I'll get married,
and she'll become a good mother.

615
00:56:27.384 --> 00:56:32.013
I will provide a good family environment
so Na Hyun will grow up properly.

616
00:56:32.013 --> 00:56:35.997
That... has nothing to do
with this incident.

617
00:56:36.587 --> 00:56:41.250
I was unable to speak to her about
this topic because I'm her father.

618
00:56:41.250 --> 00:56:43.419
Things can change
if a mother comes into the picture.

619
00:56:43.419 --> 00:56:47.935
Problematic kids are problematic,
even if they have mothers.

620
00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:51.835
I will pay more attention to Na Hyun

621
00:56:51.835 --> 00:56:55.024
- so she can do well in school...
- Na Hyun's father.

622
00:56:55.024 --> 00:56:57.984
Didn't you say you saw what Na Hyun did?

623
00:56:58.705 --> 00:57:01.335
- Yes.
- Do you think that's something

624
00:57:01.335 --> 00:57:04.870
that a female student should do?

625
00:57:05.837 --> 00:57:06.895
I'm sorry.

626
00:57:06.895 --> 00:57:10.817
I'm asking you about your thoughts.

627
00:57:10.817 --> 00:57:12.654
Is this something she should do or not?

628
00:57:12.654 --> 00:57:16.049
<i>[Disciplinary Committee Meeting]</i>

629
00:57:29.609 --> 00:57:31.085
It's not...

630
00:57:32.734 --> 00:57:34.024
something she should have done.

631
00:57:34.024 --> 00:57:38.020
Is this something that
should happen or not?

632
00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:41.527
It shouldn't... happen.

633
00:57:41.527 --> 00:57:44.198
Are you asking for forgiveness
while knowing that?

634
00:57:44.198 --> 00:57:48.797
Na Hyun is still a young child.
And we're adults.

635
00:57:49.919 --> 00:57:52.982
- Forgiveness can be a lesson.
- As...

636
00:57:52.982 --> 00:57:55.377
the president of the parents' association

637
00:57:55.377 --> 00:57:59.948
I don't think our kids
should study at the same school

638
00:57:59.948 --> 00:58:03.172
as someone who films such dirty footage.

639
00:58:03.172 --> 00:58:06.185
I feel very strongly about this.

640
00:58:19.201 --> 00:58:21.710
<i>Na Hyun made a three-minute film.</i>

641
00:58:22.377 --> 00:58:26.618
I know it was so wrong
that it affected the school environment.

642
00:58:26.618 --> 00:58:31.522
My daughter and I
are reflecting on our mistakes.

643
00:58:48.049 --> 00:58:49.602
I'm begging you.

644
00:58:50.386 --> 00:58:52.821
Please don't expel my daughter.

645
00:58:55.187 --> 00:58:56.602
I'm begging you.

646
00:59:02.027 --> 00:59:04.870
<i>I can become even more
cowardly than this.</i>

647
00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:07.785
<i>Although, you probably don't know.</i>

648
00:59:30.727 --> 00:59:31.953
What did they say?

649
00:59:40.533 --> 00:59:42.082
Let's go home.

650
00:59:46.259 --> 00:59:48.738
We heard the guardian's perspective.

651
00:59:48.738 --> 00:59:50.930
Why don't we begin the meeting?

652
00:59:51.767 --> 00:59:55.933
- Shall we vote?
- It's an open vote, anyway.

653
00:59:55.933 --> 00:59:58.960
Why don't we just have
a show of hands, Principal?

654
00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:00.663
Let's do that.

655
01:00:00.663 --> 01:00:07.038
Then, who thinks we should
expel Jung Na Hyun?

656
01:00:09.518 --> 01:00:12.790
I didn't do anything wrong.
You know that too.

657
01:00:14.377 --> 01:00:16.870
Should we eat something
delicious before we go home?

658
01:00:17.919 --> 01:00:19.489
Sure.

659
01:00:20.953 --> 01:00:24.814
- Korean sausages?
- I don't like Korean sausages.

660
01:00:27.359 --> 01:00:28.864
Pork cutlets?

661
01:00:29.718 --> 01:00:31.817
Sure, let's eat pork cutlets.

662
01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:41.446
It's nice to have a long
conversation with my daughter.

663
01:00:41.446 --> 01:00:43.504
Let's talk lots tomorrow, too.

664
01:00:44.098 --> 01:00:46.165
It's not like we ever stopped talking.

665
01:00:48.426 --> 01:00:51.935
I'm so happy to hold my daughter's hand.

666
01:00:54.984 --> 01:00:57.285
<i>When I hold the hand of someone I love</i>

667
01:00:57.285 --> 01:01:00.408
<i>I want to keep walking
until the end of time.</i>

668
01:01:01.415 --> 01:01:04.560
<i>Even if the the land ends,
and the ocean begins</i>

669
01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:06.897
<i>I don't want to let go.</i>

670
01:01:08.553 --> 01:01:11.285
<i>That's why people
who hold hands at the beach</i>

671
01:01:12.421 --> 01:01:14.643
<i>are people who love each other.</i>

672
01:01:15.658 --> 01:01:18.631
What's that movie called?

673
01:01:18.631 --> 01:01:20.410
"A Man and a Woman."

674
01:01:20.410 --> 01:01:24.259
The original title is
"Un Homme et Une Femme."

675
01:01:24.259 --> 01:01:26.033
What does it mean?

676
01:01:26.033 --> 01:01:29.058
A man and a woman.

677
01:01:33.448 --> 01:01:36.689
A man and a woman...

678
01:01:37.317 --> 01:01:39.062
are right here.

679
01:01:57.812 --> 01:02:04.812

stand Dad, but I never resented him.</i>

687

<i>- Jung Na Hyun!
- Dad feels the same way.</i>

688
01:02:43.256 --> 01:02:46.017
<i>He'll never resent me.</i>
