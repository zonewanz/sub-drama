00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.200
(Episode 21)

2
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.400
Ji Soo.

3
00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:34.699
You witch.

4
00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:39.809
Why...

5
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.809
did you hit me?

6
00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:45.080
Because even you deceived me.

7
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.949
You knew everything.

8
00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:48.949
You knew it wasn't you.

9
00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:52.449
You knew Mom and Dad sent you instead of me.

10
00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:55.589
Is that...

11
00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.729
why you hit me?

12
00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.460
We were twins.

13
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.170
I told you everything, but you didn't.

14
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.799
Not even you...

15
00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:08.939
accepted me as your family.

16
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.179
Don't get me wrong.

17
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.649
I didn't know either when I first got there.

18
00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:19.549
Do you think I'm that foolish?

19
00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:21.879
You should've told me as soon as you found out.

20
00:01:21.879 --> 00:01:23.989
Why would you stay there until now?

21
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.090
Did you like it there that much?

22
00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:29.289
You kicked me out when I visited you at work.

23
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.530
You said you were sorry.

24
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.629
Did you like money that much?

25
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.299
Mom, Dad, and even you...

26
00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:38.899
liked money more than you all liked me.

27
00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:44.510
Why are you so quiet?

28
00:01:44.769 --> 00:01:46.170
Why are you staring at me like that?

29
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.510
Say something.

30
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.209
You are...

31
00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:55.250
so selfish.

32
00:01:56.519 --> 00:01:57.519
What?

33
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.289
You only think about yourself...

34
00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:02.689
at the most crucial moments.

35
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.730
You only think in your shoes.

36
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.230
Just like when you told me not to go.

37
00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:10.570
What do you mean?

38
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.299
Have you ever considered why I did all that?

39
00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:17.570
Have you ever thought in my shoes?

40
00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.380
When I first said that I'll go to that house,

41
00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.519
you only cared about how you feel but not me.

42
00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:32.249
Even now, you won't listen to me.

43
00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:34.019
Why would I put myself in your shoes?

44
00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.690
You already deceived me.

45
00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:37.790
You didn't tell me the truth when you found out.

46
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.690
You continued to keep it a secret.

47
00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.730
You couldn't even trust me.

48
00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:43.999
But you're calling me selfish?

49
00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:47.269
How could you say that to me?

50
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.140
When Dad's business went under,

51
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.869
we lived in Busan for 10 months.

52
00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:52.969
Then we had to move...

53
00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:54.540
to Masan for his new job there.

54
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.679
My homeroom teacher got me a scholarship,

55
00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.749
so I was going to stay in Busan...

56
00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:03.149
and live at the dorm until I went to college.

57
00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:04.850
At that time, you...

58
00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:08.360
You were scared of going to the new school alone...

59
00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.929
and didn't eat for a week.

60
00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.390
So I gave up my scholarship in the end...

61
00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.299
and followed you to that small studio in Masan.

62
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.869
Why are you bringing that up now?

63
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.399
Are you trying to call it even because...

64
00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:21.670
you suffered from my stubbornness?

65
00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:23.440
It was your decision.

66
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.440
You could've stayed in Busan.

67
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.809
I just couldn't eat because I was too upset...

68
00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:29.640
to stay apart from you.

69
00:03:29.664 --> 00:03:34.664
<font face="Papyrus" color="#00ff00">Subtitle ripped and resynced by redixion</font>

70
00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:35.749
What's this now?

71
00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:37.749
Do you...

72
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.820
Do you think this isn't fair for you?

73
00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:41.890
No.

74
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.330
How could I think that?

75
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.330
My parents picked you up, raised you,

76
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.869
and changed your life.

77
00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:52.499
"My parents"?

78
00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.010
Fine.

79
00:03:57.969 --> 00:03:59.640
Your mom sent you instead of me...

80
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.380
and received a restaurant in exchange.

81
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.309
And you stayed there when you knew the truth!

82
00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:05.880
What?

83
00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:07.980
Those are your parents indeed.

84
00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.149
They care about money more than me.

85
00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:47.820
Mother called for me, so I'm here.

86
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.990
My name is Choi Eun Seok.

87
00:04:50.459 --> 00:04:52.229
She certainly does belong to our family.

88
00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:57.000
I'm glad to have you back, my dear niece.

89
00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:58.700
What should I do?

90
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.880
Someone sent me an anonymous letter.

91
00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.149
(To Vice Chairman Choi Jae Sung)

92
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.490
Those imbeciles.

93
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.039
Among this month's proposals,

94
00:05:35.769 --> 00:05:38.510
I like the idea of also selling products...

95
00:05:38.709 --> 00:05:41.209
such as candles, hand cream, and face packs,

96
00:05:41.209 --> 00:05:44.080
which female customers would like.

97
00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:46.050
Proceed with the proposal.

98
00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:48.649
Well, about that...

99
00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:51.690
That proposal has been submitted by Ms. Seo.

100
00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:54.719
Is that so?

101
00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:56.490
Since she submitted before her resignation...

102
00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.529
as an employee of this company,

103
00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:00.700
it won't be a problem for us to proceed.

104
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.760
But I'd like to inform you about this just in case.

105
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.800
Is there a way to bring her back?

106
00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:10.539
No.

107
00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.909
She had a pressing matter regarding her family.

108
00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:14.940
She told me that she had no choice but to resign.

109
00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.479
What is it about?

110
00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:18.950
Since we are discussing about Ms. Seo,

111
00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:21.450
I should inform you about Ms. Yoon Ha Jung.

112
00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:25.019
We've decided not to report her to the police.

113
00:06:25.019 --> 00:06:27.089
The legal team is going to handle this matter.

114
00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:29.019
She will pay for the damage,

115
00:06:29.019 --> 00:06:30.289
and she'll be relieved of her position.

116
00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:35.060
She's not that bad.

117
00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:40.070
But by the way,

118
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.940
isn't Ms. Seo irresponsible?

119
00:06:43.209 --> 00:06:45.539
She didn't even train a new employee. Gosh.

120
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.640
You said she completed all given tasks.

121
00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.180
Didn't you personally tell me...

122
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.409
that she handed over the files to you?

123
00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:54.419
How is that irresponsible?

124
00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:56.219
You're right.

125
00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.490
Please excuse me.

126
00:07:07.099 --> 00:07:08.630
This is Choi Do Kyung.

127
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:09.830
Vice President Choi,

128
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.240
Ms. Seo's mother, Ms. Yang Mi Jung, is here.

129
00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.240
Sorry?

130
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.409
She's been kneeling down ever since she came.

131
00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:22.640
I thought I should let you know.

132
00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:26.979
I'll go on living my life like I did before.

133
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:28.950
So...

134
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.519
don't expect anything else from me.

135
00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:36.659
What can I do for you?

136
00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:39.289
I'll see that...

137
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.659
your parents don't...

138
00:07:42.659 --> 00:07:44.130
end up being sued.

139
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.130
If I tell them about it,

140
00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:48.500
maybe they might trample on my parents a bit less.

141
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:49.940
You also know...

142
00:07:50.969 --> 00:07:53.440
what Mother and Father will do to my parents.

143
00:07:58.109 --> 00:08:04.620
(A pleasant trip starts at the bus terminal.)

144
00:08:33.249 --> 00:08:34.450
Please get up.

145
00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:39.959
It's all right. Please get up.

146
00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:44.060
I shouldn't.

147
00:08:45.759 --> 00:08:47.999
General Manager Min, call a taxi...

148
00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:50.599
and help her up, please.

149
00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:52.969
No, I can't.

150
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.040
I must see Ms. No before I leave.

151
00:08:56.839 --> 00:08:58.339
I need her permission.

152
00:08:59.239 --> 00:09:01.339
You can do as Vice President Choi says.

153
00:09:02.109 --> 00:09:03.209
Please.

154
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.160
Vice President Choi will take care of it.

155
00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.759
You can go home without any worries.

156
00:09:22.459 --> 00:09:23.570
Go on.

157
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:40.479
- Drive safely. - Okay.

158
00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:49.759
I'm going back to my office.

159
00:09:49.759 --> 00:09:50.859
Have a good day.

160
00:10:10.749 --> 00:10:14.219
Ji An was under a lot of pressure.

161
00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:18.520
She was in charge of a huge project at work.

162
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.759
She wanted to confess after it succeeded...

163
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.229
to earn forgiveness for her parents.

164
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:27.700
That's what she wanted,

165
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:30.869
but I guess it didn't work out.

166
00:10:31.999 --> 00:10:35.369
You should have told me once you found out.

167
00:10:40.609 --> 00:10:41.709
Honey.

168
00:10:44.849 --> 00:10:46.349
Tae Soo.

169
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.219
Ji An...

170
00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:54.089
Ms. No is going to take it out on Ji An.

171
00:10:55.489 --> 00:10:57.790
What... What do you mean?

172
00:10:58.589 --> 00:10:59.859
Ms. No of Haesung Corporation...

173
00:10:59.859 --> 00:11:02.030
is going to make sure Ji An doesn't get a job.

174
00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:03.670
Not even as a contract worker.

175
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:05.229
She's going to punish me...

176
00:11:05.229 --> 00:11:06.670
by trampling on Ji An's life.

177
00:11:08.739 --> 00:11:10.540
What should I do?

178
00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:12.739
What should I do with our poor Ji An?

179
00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.509
I must have lost my mind.

180
00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.280
I should have listened to you.

181
00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.879
I should have listened to you.

182
00:11:20.479 --> 00:11:22.379
What.. What are you saying?

183
00:11:22.619 --> 00:11:24.619
You're not making any sense.

184
00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:34.859
She doesn't want you to quit the restaurant?

185
00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.099
What does she mean by that?

186
00:11:37.099 --> 00:11:38.830
Are you sure that's what you heard?

187
00:11:39.629 --> 00:11:41.070
What... What about Soo A?

188
00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.099
How do they know about Soo A?

189
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:46.310
They already knew. They knew about her.

190
00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:48.910
She told me that if I quit the restaurant,

191
00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:50.680
she's going to make sure that...

192
00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:54.180
Ji Tae, Soo A, and Ji Ho lose their jobs.

193
00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:57.320
That's what she told me.

194
00:11:58.719 --> 00:12:01.619
She was terrifying.

195
00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:04.259
She spoke sharply and clearly...

196
00:12:04.729 --> 00:12:06.359
to avoid any misunderstandings.

197
00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:08.430
That's how she spoke.

198
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:10.670
What on earth...

199
00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:12.830
But it was our fault.

200
00:12:15.369 --> 00:12:17.609
I'm sorry, Tae Soo.

201
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:22.180
If only we lived better like the old days,

202
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.080
I wouldn't have Ji Soo sent away.

203
00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:28.219
The DNA test?

204
00:12:28.219 --> 00:12:30.020
They couldn't have been able to force it.

205
00:12:30.749 --> 00:12:32.249
She could've died.

206
00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:34.160
She could've died there.

207
00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.660
You're still making excuses?

208
00:12:35.889 --> 00:12:37.190
Stop it now.

209
00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.530
No matter how much you loved her,

210
00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:40.700
she's not ours.

211
00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.930
Our feelings don't matter at all now.

212
00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:46.129
We have to think about how to fix this mess.

213
00:12:49.099 --> 00:12:50.369
What do we do?

214
00:12:52.239 --> 00:12:53.509
We have to turn ourselves in.

215
00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:56.780
But first, we need to apologize.

216
00:13:30.479 --> 00:13:33.420
Are you the man who tried to sell his daughter?

217
00:13:35.479 --> 00:13:36.790
Bring my daughter to me.

218
00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:39.050
I don't want her to stay here any longer.

219
00:13:41.959 --> 00:13:43.060
Eun Seok.

220
00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.290
Eun Seok!

221
00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:52.430
Why was I so reckless? I should've been careful.

222
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:56.810
Ji Soo works at a bakery in Yeonnam-dong.

223
00:14:01.979 --> 00:14:05.849
Sir, Mr. Seo Tae Soo is asking to see you.

224
00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:07.749
Seo Tae Soo?

225
00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:09.379
Should I tell him to leave?

226
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:13.719
Bring him up.

227
00:14:19.589 --> 00:14:21.359
I was going to send you away,

228
00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.129
but I was afraid you were going to make a commotion,

229
00:14:25.469 --> 00:14:27.670
and I wanted to talk about my daughter.

230
00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:30.869
Thank you, sir.

231
00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:34.780
I know why you're here, so hold your tongue.

232
00:14:35.109 --> 00:14:36.139
I will talk.

233
00:14:36.139 --> 00:14:37.410
I am sorry.

234
00:14:38.349 --> 00:14:40.119
I am sorry for what we did to Ji Soo.

235
00:14:41.349 --> 00:14:42.650
Ji Soo?

236
00:14:43.349 --> 00:14:46.089
Ji Soo is still Ji Soo.

237
00:14:46.759 --> 00:14:48.719
So I'd like to apologize to you as her father,

238
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:52.530
not as the vice chairman of Haesung Corporation.

239
00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:56.800
You said regretting what we did...

240
00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.770
or apologizing for what we did is no good.

241
00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:04.639
But I feel ashamed to turn myself in...

242
00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:07.910
without a proper apology.

243
00:15:08.379 --> 00:15:09.910
That's why I came here.

244
00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:12.650
Turn yourself in?

245
00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.749
The day you came to our house,

246
00:15:18.589 --> 00:15:20.660
Ji An sent me a message.

247
00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:24.790
She said she was going to confess the truth,

248
00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:27.030
and she told us to turn ourselves in.

249
00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.969
Sir, please hear me out.

250
00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:36.270
I told my parents to turn themselves in tomorrow.

251
00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:38.670
I wasn't trying to fool you forever.

252
00:15:41.379 --> 00:15:43.749
Until when were you planning to fool us?

253
00:15:44.749 --> 00:15:46.080
I was going to bring her...

254
00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:50.989
when I become successful with my business.

255
00:15:51.849 --> 00:15:52.989
Business?

256
00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:54.759
Successful?

257
00:15:57.759 --> 00:16:00.930
Only if my phone didn't die...

258
00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:03.770
Only if I didn't miss the bus...

259
00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:08.239
I lost my last chance...

260
00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:10.609
to stop Ji An from going.

261
00:16:12.239 --> 00:16:15.009
But I couldn't go there the next day...

262
00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:16.650
and take Ji An back.

263
00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:20.849
She chose to go there.

264
00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:24.119
And she was already part of your family.

265
00:16:24.989 --> 00:16:26.150
I couldn't dare...

266
00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.719
to tell her that it wasn't her.

267
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:32.729
Life must've been so tough for her...

268
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:35.300
to abandon her parents whom she lived with...

269
00:16:35.959 --> 00:16:38.729
for 28 years in a matter of a few days.

270
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:42.969
I was more worried about Ji An...

271
00:16:44.109 --> 00:16:45.910
than about deceiving you and your wife.

272
00:16:46.709 --> 00:16:48.239
I wanted to do everything to get back on my feet...

273
00:16:49.239 --> 00:16:50.709
so that when Ji An finally comes back,

274
00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:55.280
she would feel less miserable.

275
00:16:56.249 --> 00:16:58.190
You weren't intending to fool us forever?

276
00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:00.359
Did you come here to give that excuse?

277
00:17:00.459 --> 00:17:02.359
No. That's not it.

278
00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:08.000
I wanted to tell you why everything happened...

279
00:17:08.659 --> 00:17:12.270
before I get punished. I had to do it.

280
00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:15.740
You're just scared of my wife's warning.

281
00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:16.869
Yes.

282
00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.240
I am scared.

283
00:17:20.879 --> 00:17:22.240
As per the restaurant,

284
00:17:22.909 --> 00:17:25.810
my wife will work there forever without any pay...

285
00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.480
if you tell her to do so.

286
00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:32.020
No. If you tell us both to go to prison, we will.

287
00:17:32.389 --> 00:17:35.159
We will do everything you tell us to do.

288
00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:37.830
Can you just...

289
00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:42.000
punish us and...

290
00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:45.669
forgive Ji An?

291
00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:50.070
Ms. Yang Mi Jung is here kneeling down.

292
00:17:50.869 --> 00:17:52.869
You're here to apologize, so just apologize.

293
00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:55.510
You're not in a position to ask for a favor.

294
00:17:58.250 --> 00:17:59.480
Ji An...

295
00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.550
hasn't come home yet.

296
00:18:03.649 --> 00:18:05.189
She didn't go home?

297
00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:10.359
How could she manage to look at us?

298
00:18:11.359 --> 00:18:13.030
So when Ji An comes back,

299
00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:15.260
we will apologize to her...

300
00:18:16.099 --> 00:18:17.429
and turn ourselves in.

301
00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:20.199
I've come to ask for your permission.

302
00:18:21.669 --> 00:18:23.369
After I take my daughter,

303
00:18:23.939 --> 00:18:25.839
we will talk about how we will punish you.

304
00:18:29.949 --> 00:18:31.310
Ji Soo...

305
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:34.750
If you're sorry to us, make her come to us.

306
00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.919
She must've been hurt too.

307
00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:39.550
I will pick her up this weekend.

308
00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:46.389
Just because I understand what you said...

309
00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.460
doesn't mean your actions are justified or forgiven.

310
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.129
Yes.

311
00:18:53.099 --> 00:18:54.570
I am aware of it.

312
00:18:55.939 --> 00:18:57.070
You may go.

313
00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:59.770
There's one more thing I want to tell you.

314
00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:02.710
25 years ago,

315
00:19:03.379 --> 00:19:06.149
we started raising Ji Soo without reporting it.

316
00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.449
That was a very wrong thing to do.

317
00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.349
But if we had the slightest doubt...

318
00:19:12.119 --> 00:19:14.790
that she was someone's lost child,

319
00:19:15.919 --> 00:19:17.659
no matter how much my wife begged,

320
00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:20.760
I wouldn't have taken her home.

321
00:19:22.099 --> 00:19:23.399
What do you mean?

322
00:19:24.699 --> 00:19:26.199
Where we found Ji Soo...

323
00:19:26.599 --> 00:19:30.369
was a deserted area without any residents.

324
00:19:32.109 --> 00:19:34.939
There were only a few abandoned houses...

325
00:19:35.679 --> 00:19:37.780
and my parents' graves, which you had to...

326
00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:40.349
go through the thick vines to get to.

327
00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:42.580
It was a desolate place.

328
00:19:43.149 --> 00:19:44.689
A desolate place?

329
00:19:45.849 --> 00:19:46.919
I thought...

330
00:19:47.859 --> 00:19:49.560
her parents didn't care if she died...

331
00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:53.199
and abandoned her.

332
00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:55.560
Where is that?

333
00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:57.669
Where did you find Eun Seok?

334
00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.109
What brings you here, ma'am?

335
00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.649
Write down what I say.

336
00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:26.030
Gangwon Province.

337
00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:29.899
Cheolwon-gun.

338
00:20:30.669 --> 00:20:32.099
The Civilian Control Line.

339
00:20:35.369 --> 00:20:36.369
Give it to me.

340
00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.280
What is this for, ma'am?

341
00:20:41.939 --> 00:20:43.409
I let you live...

342
00:20:43.649 --> 00:20:46.520
because you helped us to find our daughter.

343
00:20:46.619 --> 00:20:50.889
We locked ourselves up here like you told us.

344
00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:52.750
We've been good.

345
00:20:53.619 --> 00:20:55.159
You have to be good...

346
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:57.429
if you want to live.

347
00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:58.790
By the way,

348
00:20:59.359 --> 00:21:01.060
when will we get the rest of the money?

349
00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:03.399
Can you tell us that?

350
00:21:04.669 --> 00:21:05.970
When the time comes.

351
00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:25.320
Get more people and watch them for 24 hours.

352
00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:26.520
We will do that, ma'am.

353
00:21:43.369 --> 00:21:46.109
She's giving them an order.

354
00:21:46.879 --> 00:21:48.139
I am so scared.

355
00:21:49.379 --> 00:21:52.179
Good thing we didn't tell the truth that time.

356
00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:56.449
Yes. You surely think fast.

357
00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:57.689
Yes.

358
00:21:58.449 --> 00:22:00.619
After we abandoned Eun Seok,

359
00:22:01.189 --> 00:22:04.060
we lied that we watched until someone took her.

360
00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:07.230
Had we not lied, we would not have gotten paid.

361
00:22:07.599 --> 00:22:11.000
There was a big rain storm that night.

362
00:22:12.099 --> 00:22:13.869
If Tae Soo didn't take her,

363
00:22:14.169 --> 00:22:15.839
she would've died there.

364
00:22:17.109 --> 00:22:18.909
Stop saying such unlucky things!

365
00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:23.909
You never know who might hear it.

366
00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:28.020
Hello. You're here.

367
00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:29.050
Hello.

368
00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:34.490
I came here because she's out of reach.

369
00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:35.560
And she's not here either.

370
00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:37.460
She's not coming today.

371
00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:39.560
She's not coming?

372
00:22:45.199 --> 00:22:46.399
What did he say?

373
00:22:47.339 --> 00:22:50.570
He wants to take Ji Soo first.

374
00:22:53.839 --> 00:22:55.010
Oh, no.

375
00:23:02.919 --> 00:23:03.990
I...

376
00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:07.089
I can't say anything to Ji Soo.

377
00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:09.960
I will talk to her.

378
00:23:11.089 --> 00:23:12.189
Before she leaves,

379
00:23:12.189 --> 00:23:14.429
we need to make her feel better.

380
00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:18.530
When she's upset,

381
00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:21.099
she doesn't listen to anyone, you know.

382
00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:23.939
What if...

383
00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:27.139
she leaves while misunderstanding us?

384
00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:29.949
Where and what on earth is Ji An doing?

385
00:23:29.949 --> 00:23:31.980
Why isn't she home yet?

386
00:23:39.889 --> 00:23:40.990
Miss...

387
00:23:45.659 --> 00:23:47.530
Did you send Mi Jung home?

388
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.659
Apparently, it was Do Kyung.

389
00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:51.800
Do Kyung did?

390
00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:55.770
Let's talk.

391
00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:03.879
Turn themselves in?

392
00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.310
He came to me and told me.

393
00:24:06.649 --> 00:24:07.849
When Ji An returns,

394
00:24:07.849 --> 00:24:10.290
he's going to apologize to her and turn himself in.

395
00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:12.449
When Ji An returns?

396
00:24:12.449 --> 00:24:13.919
What does that mean?

397
00:24:13.919 --> 00:24:15.560
She didn't go home.

398
00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.990
But she left yesterday. How could she not go home?

399
00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:20.359
Where is she now then?

400
00:24:20.359 --> 00:24:22.199
It's nothing we should care about, is it?

401
00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:26.970
You're right.

402
00:24:27.339 --> 00:24:29.070
Habit is a scary thing.

403
00:24:30.169 --> 00:24:31.639
So what did you say?

404
00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:33.439
You didn't tell them to turn themselves in, right?

405
00:24:33.879 --> 00:24:36.010
You can't let them go to the police station.

406
00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:37.810
Reporters will crowd around them like bees.

407
00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:39.679
Her name is Seo Ji Soo, right?

408
00:24:40.179 --> 00:24:41.780
I said we would decide what to do with them...

409
00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:43.250
after we bring her home.

410
00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.990
That's good.

411
00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:47.419
What will we do now?

412
00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:50.689
Your father, sister, Mr. Jung,

413
00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:52.530
New World Group,

414
00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:54.599
and even Ms. Hong and Ms. Jin.

415
00:24:54.929 --> 00:24:58.070
I can't tell them that Ji An is not Eun Seok.

416
00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:02.470
I can't tell my father or my sister.

417
00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:05.270
I can't tell Mr. Jang or New World Group either.

418
00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.909
It will ruin Do Kyung and Seo Hyun's marriage too.

419
00:25:10.649 --> 00:25:12.210
I am thinking...

420
00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:13.550
about how to solve this problem.

421
00:25:14.349 --> 00:25:15.449
But first,

422
00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:18.949
shouldn't we find out who sent me the letter?

423
00:25:19.919 --> 00:25:22.659
I think it's that woman, Jo Soon Ok.

424
00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:26.230
It's not her.

425
00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:27.859
I made sure she doesn't say a word.

426
00:25:28.659 --> 00:25:31.070
But shouldn't we still find out where she is?

427
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:32.599
I am looking for her.

428
00:25:33.199 --> 00:25:36.240
And we don't need to worry about the letter.

429
00:25:36.609 --> 00:25:38.339
We don't need to worry about the letter?

430
00:25:38.339 --> 00:25:40.179
They're not asking for money yet.

431
00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:43.179
Someone will soon call and ask for money.

432
00:25:43.179 --> 00:25:44.349
We can catch the person then,

433
00:25:44.349 --> 00:25:46.250
and when we do, we will know who it is.

434
00:25:47.379 --> 00:25:49.179
We'll see if it's an outsider...

435
00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.149
or an insider.

436
00:25:56.119 --> 00:25:57.830
Do Kyung is home.

437
00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:02.859
I'm home.

438
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.899
Who do you think you are?

439
00:26:07.899 --> 00:26:09.599
How dare you let Mi Jung go?

440
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:11.439
Why would you step in?

441
00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:13.540
Was covering up for that girl not enough?

442
00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:15.179
How can you cover up for her mother too?

443
00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.909
She was once my little sister.

444
00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:20.449
To you, she was once your daughter.

445
00:26:20.449 --> 00:26:21.550
But we were fooled.

446
00:26:22.449 --> 00:26:23.649
We were,

447
00:26:23.649 --> 00:26:25.520
but I once loved her as my little sister.

448
00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:28.859
Didn't you, Mother, Father?

449
00:26:30.659 --> 00:26:32.629
The person who was once a sister to you...

450
00:26:32.629 --> 00:26:34.230
and a daughter to us was Ji An.

451
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:36.099
We can't forgive her parents.

452
00:26:36.099 --> 00:26:37.599
Like I said,

453
00:26:38.599 --> 00:26:40.639
I insisted her to delay confessing it to you.

454
00:26:40.699 --> 00:26:44.169
And I promised Ji An that I'd make sure...

455
00:26:44.669 --> 00:26:45.970
her parents don't go to jail.

456
00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:47.480
You promised her?

457
00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:49.409
Who are you to make such a promise?

458
00:26:50.349 --> 00:26:52.280
You acted on our behalf without permission.

459
00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.619
Are you mistaken about your position?

460
00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:56.220
I met Ji Soo,

461
00:26:56.849 --> 00:26:58.619
my real little sister.

462
00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:00.960
Did you really meet her?

463
00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.830
I did.

464
00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.960
She was brought up with love.

465
00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:09.429
She was very grateful to Ji An too.

466
00:27:10.199 --> 00:27:11.429
So?

467
00:27:11.629 --> 00:27:14.270
Are you suggesting we forgive them?

468
00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:16.070
To Ji Soo, Tae Soo and Mi Jung...

469
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:17.409
were really her parents.

470
00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.540
If she finds out what you did to her mother,

471
00:27:22.139 --> 00:27:23.909
she wouldn't want to come here, would she?

472
00:27:24.909 --> 00:27:26.619
Will she be happy...

473
00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:28.849
if you send them to jail?

474
00:27:30.089 --> 00:27:31.089
You might...

475
00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:33.689
lose your actual daughter.

476
00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:34.889
But they sent their daughter here...

477
00:27:34.889 --> 00:27:37.089
instead of our daughter.

478
00:27:37.089 --> 00:27:38.730
Ji Soo was a very compassionate person.

479
00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:41.730
She would resent them, but she will still love them.

480
00:27:43.629 --> 00:27:45.830
To welcome her as your daughter,

481
00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.099
you have to make sure she gets hurt less.

482
00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:51.439
You have a lot to learn.

483
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:53.909
You don't see the big picture.

484
00:27:57.250 --> 00:27:58.609
I will meet Ji Soo...

485
00:27:58.609 --> 00:27:59.980
and prepare her well.

486
00:28:00.879 --> 00:28:02.949
No. I will meet her.

487
00:28:03.919 --> 00:28:05.689
You said she works at a bakery, right?

488
00:28:05.689 --> 00:28:06.889
Where is that place?

489
00:28:08.419 --> 00:28:10.760
You're going to meet her in public?

490
00:28:12.089 --> 00:28:13.300
Shouldn't we come up...

491
00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:15.060
with a plan before we meet her?

492
00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:17.169
You are going to make the plan anyway.

493
00:28:17.169 --> 00:28:19.730
It's not like paparazzi come after me.

494
00:28:20.439 --> 00:28:23.099
I will go and talk to her alone.

495
00:28:24.609 --> 00:28:25.740
How about you, Mother?

496
00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:29.810
Don't you want to see Ji Soo, Mother?

497
00:28:40.359 --> 00:28:43.490
Don't you want to see Ji Soo, Mother?

498
00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:57.070
You're no doubt my daughter.

499
00:29:08.949 --> 00:29:10.919
I can't forgive Mi Jung.

500
00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:14.159
But first, what we should do about Seo Hyun?

501
00:29:14.159 --> 00:29:15.589
She would be shocked too.

502
00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:19.960
Let's tell Seo Hyun about it...

503
00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:21.260
when we get it all figured out.

504
00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:22.359
She thinks Eun Seok...

505
00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.800
I mean, she thinks that girl...

506
00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.899
is staying at the office.

507
00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:33.939
(Eun Seok from Haesung goes missing.)

508
00:29:40.419 --> 00:29:42.949
- Welcome. - Take a look around.

509
00:29:42.949 --> 00:29:44.849
This, this, this, this,

510
00:29:44.849 --> 00:29:45.990
and this.

511
00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:47.320
I wear size six.

512
00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:48.460
- Size six. - Yes.

513
00:29:49.419 --> 00:29:50.560
5 pairs are enough to...

514
00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.260
borrow him for 30 minutes, aren't they?

515
00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.899
Yes. Of course they are.

516
00:29:59.129 --> 00:30:01.639
- Please. - Go.

517
00:30:02.899 --> 00:30:04.310
You're really here.

518
00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:05.909
You told me to come here to talk to you.

519
00:30:07.139 --> 00:30:08.740
Hey. Hey.

520
00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:09.980
Come on.

521
00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:11.949
I'll be back. How can you sell me?

522
00:30:11.949 --> 00:30:14.250
You can take more time.

523
00:30:15.349 --> 00:30:16.480
What is it?

524
00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.250
Why are you taking me to a corner?

525
00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:21.389
You said you work here...

526
00:30:21.389 --> 00:30:22.960
and at the club to earn money, right?

527
00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:26.089
I'll pay you if you help me.

528
00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:28.629
You're going to pay me if I help you?

529
00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:31.830
I am a little scared,

530
00:30:32.129 --> 00:30:34.099
but I have no one to talk to about it.

531
00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:35.669
What is it?

532
00:30:36.169 --> 00:30:38.040
It's just too strange.

533
00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:40.810
Why? Did your bodyguard ask for money?

534
00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:42.810
How did you know that?

535
00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:44.280
Did he really ask for money?

536
00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:46.820
He's unbelievable.

537
00:30:48.379 --> 00:30:49.379
By any chance,

538
00:30:50.689 --> 00:30:52.189
did you do it with him?

539
00:30:52.649 --> 00:30:54.659
I told you to watch out for him.

540
00:30:54.659 --> 00:30:56.119
What do you mean by that?

541
00:30:56.790 --> 00:30:58.260
Are you asking if we played together?

542
00:30:58.460 --> 00:30:59.929
My goodness.

543
00:31:00.159 --> 00:31:02.359
You don't know anything, do you?

544
00:31:02.359 --> 00:31:04.570
Hey, don't insult me.

545
00:31:04.869 --> 00:31:05.929
That day,

546
00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:08.669
I saw you two kissing.

547
00:31:08.669 --> 00:31:10.409
Thanks to you, our lips didn't meet.

548
00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:13.839
So nothing happened. Why is he asking for money?

549
00:31:14.909 --> 00:31:17.210
It's not him. It's his wife.

550
00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:18.449
Wife?

551
00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.250
There was a rumor that he's married.

552
00:31:22.619 --> 00:31:24.119
So he was already married.

553
00:31:26.089 --> 00:31:27.220
He's got a child too.

554
00:31:27.589 --> 00:31:28.960
Oh, my gosh.

555
00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:32.629
I can't let this get out.

556
00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:35.230
My mother, father, and brother can't find out.

557
00:31:35.859 --> 00:31:38.070
But you're my sister's little brother.

558
00:31:38.399 --> 00:31:40.570
And I like your sister a little more now.

559
00:31:41.199 --> 00:31:43.099
That's why I came to you.

560
00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:45.470
You are the only one...

561
00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:46.780
who can help me.

562
00:31:47.139 --> 00:31:48.580
How much is she asking?

563
00:31:49.849 --> 00:31:51.050
700,000 dollars.

564
00:31:51.609 --> 00:31:52.949
700,000 dollars?

565
00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:57.750
I saw Ryu smiling...

566
00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:59.649
through the mirror.

567
00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.260
That's strange, isn't it?

568
00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.560
I was in pain. Why would he smile?

569
00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:05.129
He was telling me that he loves me.

570
00:32:05.859 --> 00:32:09.060
My goodness. You're in big trouble.

571
00:32:09.899 --> 00:32:11.270
What do you mean?

572
00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:16.540
How much will you pay me?

573
00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:18.210
How much do you want?

574
00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:19.980
My goodness.

575
00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:23.349
Hey. This is why you are being blackmailed.

576
00:32:23.449 --> 00:32:25.050
You asked how much I will pay you,

577
00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:27.349
so I asked how much you want me to pay you.

578
00:32:29.449 --> 00:32:30.589
I want 50,000 dollars.

579
00:32:31.149 --> 00:32:32.189
Five thousand?

580
00:32:32.849 --> 00:32:33.919
Okay.

581
00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:36.790
I want 100,000 dollars.

582
00:32:39.089 --> 00:32:42.500
Gosh, is this how rich people raise their child?

583
00:32:42.929 --> 00:32:45.000
That's why they're so spoiled.

584
00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:48.570
Stop being ridiculous. So how much do you want?

585
00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:53.480
I'm supposed to get 10 percent commission,

586
00:32:54.179 --> 00:32:56.810
but I'll ask for less as you're Ji An's sister.

587
00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:59.149
So I want 30,000 dollars ignoring fractions.

588
00:33:00.379 --> 00:33:03.649
And I'll give you another 30 percent discount,

589
00:33:04.419 --> 00:33:05.550
so I want 20,000 dollars ignoring fractions.

590
00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:07.389
Really?

591
00:33:07.889 --> 00:33:09.320
Are you sure you will help me with this?

592
00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:11.960
You promised me.

593
00:33:13.199 --> 00:33:14.199
Happy now?

594
00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:16.929
All right. Whatever.

595
00:33:22.369 --> 00:33:24.540
Why did you buy so many shoes?

596
00:33:24.869 --> 00:33:26.510
These are not even designer shoes.

597
00:33:26.609 --> 00:33:27.810
Just get in the car.

598
00:33:39.919 --> 00:33:41.589
Don't look back and just listen to me.

599
00:33:42.589 --> 00:33:43.659
Yes.

600
00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:46.830
You know what?

601
00:33:47.099 --> 00:33:50.199
You shouldn't drive until I scrape 700,000 dollars.

602
00:33:50.629 --> 00:33:51.770
Why?

603
00:33:51.869 --> 00:33:53.540
I'm afraid of your wife.

604
00:33:54.099 --> 00:33:57.339
I told you. I'm 200,000 dollars short.

605
00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:01.379
But what if she takes pictures of us again?

606
00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:05.080
Then why don't we give her 500,000 dollars first?

607
00:34:07.119 --> 00:34:08.449
Don't be ridiculous.

608
00:34:09.449 --> 00:34:10.750
You shouldn't sign an agreement...

609
00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:14.619
unless you're completely prepared.

610
00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:17.590
Okay.

611
00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:34.409
Ji Tae.

612
00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:36.610
Aren't your eyes sore?

613
00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:40.150
This is really fun.

614
00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:42.750
Let's go home.

615
00:34:44.549 --> 00:34:46.020
I'll finish this book first.

616
00:34:49.119 --> 00:34:51.360
I want to go home and get some rest.

617
00:34:55.029 --> 00:34:57.500
Let's go home.

618
00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:02.099
It's our sweet home.

619
00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.440
Our sweet marital home.

620
00:35:09.139 --> 00:35:11.349
We should go to work tomorrow. Let's go.

621
00:35:18.349 --> 00:35:19.790
Isn't Ji An home yet?

622
00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:22.489
Ji Soo.

623
00:35:23.659 --> 00:35:25.960
She's not home yet.

624
00:35:26.929 --> 00:35:28.000
Really?

625
00:35:28.429 --> 00:35:30.599
I met her earlier today.

626
00:35:31.599 --> 00:35:33.099
Did you meet Ji An?

627
00:35:33.239 --> 00:35:35.869
Did Ji An call you? When? Where?

628
00:35:36.639 --> 00:35:37.969
A few hours ago.

629
00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:40.509
So you let her leave just like that?

630
00:35:40.639 --> 00:35:42.710
Why would you let your sister leave?

631
00:35:44.409 --> 00:35:45.849
You know Ji An.

632
00:35:46.679 --> 00:35:50.520
All right. I understand you are upset.

633
00:35:50.949 --> 00:35:53.659
But you should at least bring her home.

634
00:35:53.759 --> 00:35:56.659
My sister? Who's my sister?

635
00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:01.230
Ji Soo. The whole thing isn't Ji An's fault.

636
00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:03.130
You should be furious with me.

637
00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:05.400
It's my fault and your mom's.

638
00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:09.699
What did you talk about with Ji An? Where is she?

639
00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:12.969
She's a grown-up. She'd not stay on the streets.

640
00:36:13.739 --> 00:36:16.040
It was just one night. It's been only a day.

641
00:36:16.409 --> 00:36:18.179
It's not that the sky is falling.

642
00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:21.420
It might be more than a day.

643
00:36:21.949 --> 00:36:23.849
Put yourself in Ji An's shoes.

644
00:36:23.849 --> 00:36:25.119
Think about what she's been through.

645
00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:27.889
She must be miserable and devastated.

646
00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:29.219
What about me?

647
00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:32.060
Do you think I'm not miserable?

648
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:34.860
Do you think I'm not devastated at all?

649
00:36:36.799 --> 00:36:40.099
But you're still with us.

650
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.540
I'm afraid if Ji An might make a wrong choice.

651
00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:45.340
What if she never comes home?

652
00:36:45.509 --> 00:36:46.639
No.

653
00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:48.779
That's not happening. Don't worry about it.

654
00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:50.779
She looked quite spiteful to me.

655
00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:54.920
You think Ji An didn't do anything wrong to me?

656
00:36:55.719 --> 00:36:59.619
To me, she made a very big mistake.

657
00:37:00.119 --> 00:37:02.590
What did you talk about with Ji An?

658
00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:04.630
Where is Ji An now? She told you that, right?

659
00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:06.860
No. I don't know where she is.

660
00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:08.360
I didn't even ask.

661
00:37:08.699 --> 00:37:09.799
What?

662
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:12.730
Ji Soo, how could you do that to your sister?

663
00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:14.369
It's so heartless of you to let her go like that.

664
00:37:14.369 --> 00:37:17.040
She's not my sister. Stop saying she's my sister.

665
00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:20.210
She's just your daughter. That's why you sent her.

666
00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:22.840
You wanted her to live in affluence.

667
00:37:23.909 --> 00:37:26.110
Ji Soo, we need to talk.

668
00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:28.080
I don't want to.

669
00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.580
Ji Soo.

670
00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:02.580
I need to talk to you.

671
00:38:02.949 --> 00:38:04.190
Don't come in.

672
00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:08.719
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

673
00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:11.330
I'm so sorry.

674
00:38:12.659 --> 00:38:14.730
Please let me tell you why I did that.

675
00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.099
You'd hurt less that way.

676
00:38:18.099 --> 00:38:19.130
Okay?

677
00:38:27.779 --> 00:38:30.349
It's not that I sent Ji An because she's my daughter.

678
00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:35.520
I never thought you weren't my daughter.

679
00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:37.520
I...

680
00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:40.520
never thought...

681
00:38:41.389 --> 00:38:42.790
you're someone else's daughter.

682
00:38:44.029 --> 00:38:45.590
You should know that, Ji Soo.

683
00:38:48.199 --> 00:38:49.199
I just...

684
00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:52.099
liked you better.

685
00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:02.380
At the police station,

686
00:39:03.139 --> 00:39:04.610
I saw Ji An...

687
00:39:05.009 --> 00:39:06.750
and followed her for an hour.

688
00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:08.679
The whole time,

689
00:39:09.179 --> 00:39:10.819
she staggered along...

690
00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:12.819
and flopped down...

691
00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:14.460
crying.

692
00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:18.929
You know...

693
00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:21.630
what Ji An...

694
00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:26.639
has had to put up with her entire life.

695
00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:51.719
You're home.

696
00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:55.719
I'm sorry we're late.

697
00:40:56.830 --> 00:40:58.230
What's wrong with her?

698
00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:01.299
It's nothing. Never mind.

699
00:41:01.659 --> 00:41:05.099
I don't know what to say. You shouldn't know that.

700
00:41:06.199 --> 00:41:07.699
Just pretend that you don't know anything.

701
00:41:08.170 --> 00:41:09.540
I'm sorry.

702
00:41:10.739 --> 00:41:11.940
Go wash up.

703
00:41:25.549 --> 00:41:29.190
The number you have dialed is not in service.

704
00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:36.529
Ji An. It's me, Ji Tae.

705
00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:40.040
Are you doing all right?

706
00:41:42.469 --> 00:41:43.869
I understand how you feel.

707
00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:46.980
Just take your time and come back home.

708
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:51.779
Soo A.

709
00:41:52.509 --> 00:41:53.619
Yes, Father.

710
00:41:54.779 --> 00:41:55.920
Well...

711
00:41:56.849 --> 00:41:58.849
I want you to move out.

712
00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:00.719
Move out?

713
00:42:01.159 --> 00:42:03.190
I didn't see this coming.

714
00:42:03.989 --> 00:42:06.489
I'm so sorry and ashamed.

715
00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:10.529
This is 10,000 dollars. Get a room with it.

716
00:42:11.099 --> 00:42:12.869
You can't enjoy...

717
00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:15.699
your newly-married life like this.

718
00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:20.509
Did Ji An call you yet?

719
00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:30.310
Where's Ji Soo?

720
00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:32.810
She hasn't come down yet.

721
00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:34.219
She must be sleeping in.

722
00:43:36.619 --> 00:43:39.420
Ji Soo gets indigestion when she's angry.

723
00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:42.190
I'll go and get her.

724
00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:44.259
When she moves in with them,

725
00:43:44.929 --> 00:43:47.159
they'll make her quit the bakery.

726
00:43:48.159 --> 00:43:49.560
Even if that's the case,

727
00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:51.299
we should let her wrap it up.

728
00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:08.150
Ji Soo.

729
00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:12.190
Ji Soo.

730
00:44:19.389 --> 00:44:20.759
I'm here.

731
00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:26.299
What apprentice comes so late?

732
00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:28.000
I got here...

733
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.009
30 minutes earlier than you told me to.

734
00:44:30.009 --> 00:44:32.610
We had to come a day early in my days.

735
00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:34.940
Wash your hands and get changed.

736
00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:36.779
We're releasing the castella bread...

737
00:44:36.779 --> 00:44:38.179
and will be really busy.

738
00:44:38.679 --> 00:44:39.750
Okay.

739
00:44:44.619 --> 00:44:46.960
To that, add 50g of milk.

740
00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:48.460
30g of whipped cream.

741
00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:50.159
Measure everything accurately...

742
00:44:51.029 --> 00:44:54.500
and put everything in here with the flour.

743
00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:55.659
Okay.

744
00:45:27.730 --> 00:45:29.330
How could you?

745
00:45:31.529 --> 00:45:32.799
What happened?

746
00:45:32.799 --> 00:45:34.400
I saved your life,

747
00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:35.969
and you didn't thank me.

748
00:45:35.969 --> 00:45:37.739
You even ignored me just now.

749
00:45:39.009 --> 00:45:40.340
That's just wrong.

750
00:45:40.679 --> 00:45:43.110
Sorry. I was deep in thought.

751
00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:46.480
I'm really sorry about what happened.

752
00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:48.580
I'll make it up to you one day.

753
00:45:49.219 --> 00:45:50.489
You don't need to.

754
00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:52.619
You should thank me though.

755
00:45:53.389 --> 00:45:55.219
Thank you so much.

756
00:45:58.290 --> 00:45:59.290
Your eyes are red.

757
00:45:59.290 --> 00:46:00.460
Are you still sick?

758
00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:02.199
No, I'm fine now.

759
00:46:05.069 --> 00:46:07.199
You don't seem to be in the mood to talk.

760
00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:09.540
I'll deliver these for you.

761
00:46:09.639 --> 00:46:10.670
What?

762
00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:13.440
Thank you.

763
00:46:13.810 --> 00:46:15.710
Cheer up. Bye.

764
00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:18.679
Thank you.

765
00:46:21.449 --> 00:46:23.650
A stranger told me to cheer up.

766
00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:46.779
Sunwoo Hee.

767
00:46:48.810 --> 00:46:50.449
How dare you call me that?

768
00:46:50.449 --> 00:46:52.009
Who said you could?

769
00:46:54.319 --> 00:46:56.549
I'm just lost for words.

770
00:46:58.420 --> 00:46:59.420
You're married.

771
00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:00.889
Are you that bored?

772
00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:03.290
You're a complete scumbag.

773
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:07.529
I'm not really a scumbag.

774
00:47:07.529 --> 00:47:09.529
Don't talk like you aren't.

775
00:47:09.969 --> 00:47:12.099
Did you know I owned a cafe?

776
00:47:12.799 --> 00:47:13.799
Yes.

777
00:47:13.799 --> 00:47:15.840
Did you act like we met by chance?

778
00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:16.840
Yes.

779
00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:18.440
You came to the cafe on purpose?

780
00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:19.909
Yes.

781
00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:23.279
You ate the bread you'd made and asked...

782
00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:24.580
what flour you used.

783
00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:25.880
That was trash.

784
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:29.779
That wasn't really trash.

785
00:47:29.779 --> 00:47:31.750
You deceived and mocked me.

786
00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:33.489
A married man doing that...

787
00:47:33.489 --> 00:47:34.889
to a married woman.

788
00:47:34.889 --> 00:47:36.360
Isn't that trash?

789
00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:39.630
If a married man deceived and mocked...

790
00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:41.960
a married woman, he'd be trash.

791
00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:45.929
That's the kind of person others call a scumbag.

792
00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:47.139
A scum...

793
00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:50.409
I'm not a scumbag.

794
00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:05.119
Hee.

795
00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:07.960
Hey.

796
00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:10.290
Why do you look like you're about to cry?

797
00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:16.259
Are you crying?

798
00:48:16.259 --> 00:48:17.770
Why? Is something wrong?

799
00:48:18.299 --> 00:48:19.369
No.

800
00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:22.440
The tears are falling for no reason.

801
00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:24.270
I must be getting old.

802
00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:33.819
What's that?

803
00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:37.049
I met the bakery girl...

804
00:48:37.049 --> 00:48:38.319
and took them from her.

805
00:48:44.259 --> 00:48:45.960
- Here you go. - Thank you.

806
00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:50.469
Five dollars, please.

807
00:48:50.969 --> 00:48:52.670
Do you have any castella bread?

808
00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:54.440
Sorry, we're sold out.

809
00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:55.469
Already?

810
00:48:55.469 --> 00:48:57.909
You opened just an hour ago.

811
00:48:58.710 --> 00:49:00.810
Sir, can't you make more?

812
00:49:00.810 --> 00:49:02.940
I don't want to.

813
00:49:03.179 --> 00:49:04.650
- Bye. - Next.

814
00:49:08.779 --> 00:49:09.920
Mr. Baker.

815
00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:11.949
You said you don't like money.

816
00:49:11.949 --> 00:49:13.420
Are you pleased the new release...

817
00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:14.759
is selling well?

818
00:49:17.290 --> 00:49:18.989
You're shameless too.

819
00:49:20.099 --> 00:49:21.730
You aren't worth my time.

820
00:49:22.759 --> 00:49:24.199
Don't ever show that...

821
00:49:24.199 --> 00:49:25.869
you know me again.

822
00:49:26.469 --> 00:49:28.139
Don't come to my cafe.

823
00:49:28.239 --> 00:49:29.940
Or send your bread.

824
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:39.310
Sunwoo Hee.

825
00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:42.319
She's back to...

826
00:49:42.679 --> 00:49:43.889
being herself.

827
00:49:50.659 --> 00:49:51.759
Hey.

828
00:49:52.429 --> 00:49:53.830
The cafe owner.

829
00:49:54.159 --> 00:49:56.429
Don't you love how feisty she is?

830
00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:59.940
She even knew your name.

831
00:50:00.239 --> 00:50:01.569
What's your relationship?

832
00:50:01.569 --> 00:50:03.310
We're just acquaintances.

833
00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:06.469
If you're just acquaintances,

834
00:50:06.469 --> 00:50:07.779
why did you hide,

835
00:50:07.779 --> 00:50:09.540
and why was she angry?

836
00:50:10.279 --> 00:50:12.509
I don't know. Get back to work.

837
00:50:14.779 --> 00:50:16.819
I bet she's married.

838
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:19.790
How do you know that?

839
00:50:20.319 --> 00:50:22.290
Would someone that pretty still be single?

840
00:50:24.090 --> 00:50:29.099
Go and eat some lunch.

841
00:50:34.299 --> 00:50:36.509
(Dad)

842
00:51:03.199 --> 00:51:04.730
You didn't eat breakfast.

843
00:51:04.730 --> 00:51:06.069
Aren't you hungry?

844
00:51:08.599 --> 00:51:10.310
How did you find this place?

845
00:51:10.770 --> 00:51:13.310
This place is known in Yeonnam-dong...

846
00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:14.639
for its great pasta.

847
00:51:14.639 --> 00:51:16.040
You like pasta.

848
00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:36.670
You can't even eat right now.

849
00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:39.469
Say what you have to say.

850
00:51:39.469 --> 00:51:41.000
I'll listen as I eat.

851
00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:48.080
We sent Ji An because...

852
00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:49.880
I don't want to hear that.

853
00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:51.880
It's not because we didn't love you.

854
00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:53.349
Remember that.

855
00:51:55.949 --> 00:51:58.590
If you came here to say that, I'll go.

856
00:51:58.590 --> 00:52:01.590
No, I have something else to say.

857
00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:08.429
Your real parents...

858
00:52:10.369 --> 00:52:12.299
want us to send you.

859
00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:14.099
They want you.

860
00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:21.779
Of course they would. That's only natural.

861
00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:24.509
Because of us and Ji An,

862
00:52:24.949 --> 00:52:27.779
they almost lost you once again.

863
00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:30.619
They must want you back so much.

864
00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:33.960
If Mom hadn't lied,

865
00:52:35.659 --> 00:52:38.090
if she had said I was their daughter,

866
00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:41.929
would you say what you're saying now?

867
00:52:43.029 --> 00:52:44.730
Would you say I must go?

868
00:52:49.599 --> 00:52:50.710
I would have.

869
00:52:51.210 --> 00:52:53.540
They're your real parents.

870
00:52:57.650 --> 00:52:59.480
Then you're a fake.

871
00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:02.480
No, that's not what I mean.

872
00:53:03.619 --> 00:53:06.889
Ji Soo, I still have more to say.

873
00:53:07.090 --> 00:53:08.489
Whether I go or stay,

874
00:53:09.090 --> 00:53:10.630
that's up to me.

875
00:53:11.429 --> 00:53:13.429
Don't tell me what to do.

876
00:53:15.429 --> 00:53:16.900
Ji Soo.

877
00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:32.210
The phone is turned off.

878
00:53:32.810 --> 00:53:35.380
She must be busy. Why is her phone off?

879
00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:42.489
Hello, I'm the guy who brought the pillars.

880
00:53:43.830 --> 00:53:45.929
Ji An's friend, right?

881
00:53:45.989 --> 00:53:48.560
Yes. I don't see her anywhere.

882
00:53:48.799 --> 00:53:50.400
She quit.

883
00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:53.340
What? She quit?

884
00:53:56.540 --> 00:53:58.909
Yes. The sea!

885
00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:27.440
Come here. Come to me.

886
00:54:37.310 --> 00:54:38.449
Oh dear.

887
00:54:53.259 --> 00:54:54.630
I'm back.

888
00:54:56.770 --> 00:54:57.969
Here you go.

889
00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:02.670
Thank you.

890
00:55:04.770 --> 00:55:06.239
Did you have lunch?

891
00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:11.009
- Let's go outside. Now. - But...

892
00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:13.250
Your...

893
00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:15.650
bread...

894
00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:23.360
You can't just show up here.

895
00:55:23.659 --> 00:55:26.389
I wanted to look around and buy some bread.

896
00:55:27.830 --> 00:55:29.900
Why are you here? I'm busy.

897
00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:32.000
Sorry.

898
00:55:32.170 --> 00:55:34.639
It wouldn't have happened if I'd checked properly.

899
00:55:35.239 --> 00:55:36.469
Were you surprised?

900
00:55:37.969 --> 00:55:39.270
You feel apologetic,

901
00:55:40.179 --> 00:55:42.040
and you barged into my house like that?

902
00:55:43.250 --> 00:55:44.250
Right.

903
00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:45.909
I'm sorry you had to...

904
00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:48.520
find out the way you did.

905
00:55:49.219 --> 00:55:51.549
I'd lost reason. I was very angry.

906
00:55:51.819 --> 00:55:53.090
I was rash.

907
00:55:53.259 --> 00:55:55.719
You barged into my home and then my workplace.

908
00:55:56.060 --> 00:55:57.690
You get rash very often.

909
00:55:59.330 --> 00:56:01.360
You're right, I did it again.

910
00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:04.170
I keep having to apologize.

911
00:56:06.099 --> 00:56:08.199
If you feel bad, leave me alone.

912
00:56:09.469 --> 00:56:10.969
I know you're upset,

913
00:56:11.369 --> 00:56:13.279
but we must right the wrong.

914
00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:15.810
Says who?

915
00:56:17.009 --> 00:56:20.580
You messed up, so you get to right everything?

916
00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:23.190
This wouldn't have happened...

917
00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:24.849
if you hadn't lost me in the first place.

918
00:56:24.849 --> 00:56:26.520
We didn't lose you on purpose.

919
00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:28.790
I bet my parents didn't keep me...

920
00:56:29.290 --> 00:56:31.360
knowing you hadn't abandoned me.

921
00:56:31.659 --> 00:56:32.830
Instead of you, they...

922
00:56:32.830 --> 00:56:33.960
I don't want to hear it.

923
00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:36.770
I don't want to hear...

924
00:56:37.469 --> 00:56:39.770
any excuses from either family.

925
00:56:40.170 --> 00:56:42.170
Don't tell me what to do.

926
00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:44.270
You people are just as responsible.

927
00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:48.440
I will deal with it.

928
00:56:50.179 --> 00:56:51.380
Goodbye.

929
00:57:20.610 --> 00:57:23.179
Will you forgive me this once?

930
00:57:23.650 --> 00:57:24.679
Please?

931
00:57:30.590 --> 00:57:31.819
Please, sis.

932
00:57:32.489 --> 00:57:33.989
As if.

933
00:57:34.489 --> 00:57:35.590
Play.

934
00:57:36.929 --> 00:57:37.989
Here it goes.

935
00:57:47.569 --> 00:57:50.440
Seo Ji Tae, Ji An, Ji Soo, Ji Ho.

936
00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:52.569
- Come and eat. - We're coming.

937
00:57:52.569 --> 00:57:53.710
Carry me.

938
00:57:53.710 --> 00:57:55.080
- Okay. - Come on.

939
00:57:55.310 --> 00:57:56.549
Ready?

940
00:57:58.610 --> 00:58:00.449
- Hurry up. - Run.

941
00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:03.190
Run, run, run, Ji Soo

942
00:58:06.489 --> 00:58:07.860
You'll hurt yourselves.

943
00:58:08.389 --> 00:58:09.489
You okay?

944
00:58:09.819 --> 00:58:11.429
- That was deliberate. - Watch it.

945
00:58:11.529 --> 00:58:12.659
Neener.

946
00:58:14.159 --> 00:58:15.630
Catch me if you can.

947
00:58:15.799 --> 00:58:17.429
I will kill you.

948
00:58:17.429 --> 00:58:19.429
- Come back here! - Neener.

949
00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:24.210
I'll kill you when I get my hands on you.

950
00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:28.080
I'm coming for you!

951
00:58:51.869 --> 00:58:52.869
(Power on)

952
00:58:56.940 --> 00:58:58.270
(Contact list)

953
00:59:00.779 --> 00:59:02.179
(Texts)

954
00:59:52.290 --> 00:59:54.730
She could've called if she got home safely.

955
01:00:03.810 --> 01:00:04.810
(Seo Ji An)

956
01:00:14.949 --> 01:00:17.020
(Formatting device)

957
01:00:50.719 --> 01:00:52.449
The phone is turned off.

958
01:00:52.449 --> 01:00:54.190
Please leave a message after the beep.

959
01:01:00.599 --> 01:01:03.060
Why send the photos then turn it off?

960
01:01:05.529 --> 01:01:07.639
Can't she text if she got the voice mail?

961
01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:11.940
She's really hard-headed.

962
01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:26.389
Do you remember any of her friends from Masan?

963
01:01:27.759 --> 01:01:30.230
She studied all the time she was there.

964
01:01:30.730 --> 01:01:32.360
She had no friends.

965
01:01:43.869 --> 01:01:44.940
Ji Soo.

966
01:01:45.509 --> 01:01:46.610
Ji Soo.

967
01:01:47.279 --> 01:01:49.139
I'll go to my real parents.

968
01:01:49.509 --> 01:01:51.179
This isn't my home anymore.

969
01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:52.980
- Ji Soo. - Ji Soo.

970
01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:54.679
- This is too... - Goodbye.

971
01:01:54.679 --> 01:01:56.790
- Ji Soo. - Don't follow me out.

972
01:01:57.619 --> 01:01:59.619
No one has the right to see me off.

973
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:02.759
Don't you dare come outside.

974
01:02:03.690 --> 01:02:05.360
Don't call them either.

975
01:02:12.369 --> 01:02:13.569
Ji Soo.

976
01:02:13.770 --> 01:02:16.099
- Ji Soo. - Ji Soo. Wait, Ji Soo.

977
01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:18.569
- Ji Soo, Ji Soo. - Wait.

978
01:02:18.810 --> 01:02:20.139
Let's go.

979
01:02:20.610 --> 01:02:22.239
Ji Soo. Wait, Ji Soo.

980
01:02:22.239 --> 01:02:24.049
- Ji Soo, stop the car. - Wait.

981
01:02:24.179 --> 01:02:25.909
- Ji Soo. - Ji Soo. Hey!

982
01:02:26.310 --> 01:02:27.849
Ji Soo. Ji Soo.

983
01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:30.819
Ji Soo. Ji Soo.

984
01:03:27.679 --> 01:03:29.009
Who is it at this hour?

985
01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:38.520
Ms. No. Mr. Choi.

986
01:03:41.259 --> 01:03:42.819
Who's bothering us?

987
01:03:42.989 --> 01:03:44.090
Actually...

988
01:03:44.830 --> 01:03:47.500
It's the real Eun Seok.

989
01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:48.529
Who?

990
01:03:50.299 --> 01:03:51.469
Eun Seok?

991
01:04:17.029 --> 01:04:18.429
What's going on?

992
01:04:18.759 --> 01:04:19.759
I don't know.

993
01:04:19.759 --> 01:04:21.830
She didn't say anything when I met her.

994
01:04:22.799 --> 01:04:25.400
Why didn't they inform us?

995
01:04:25.569 --> 01:04:26.799
She's here.

996
01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:37.880
Hello.

997
01:04:38.849 --> 01:04:39.880
How...

998
01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:41.420
Is this my home?

999
01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:43.319
I heard I'm your daughter,

1000
01:04:43.319 --> 01:04:44.650
so I decided to move in.

1001
01:04:46.659 --> 01:04:48.420
Do I use Ji An's room?

1002
01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:49.759
Is it up there?

1003
01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:02.170
I'm sorry, Mom.

1004
01:05:04.270 --> 01:05:06.170
I'm sorry, Dad.

1005
01:05:09.810 --> 01:05:11.810
I'm sorry, Ji Soo.

1006
01:05:15.179 --> 01:05:17.889
I'm sorry, Ji Tae.

1007
01:05:19.489 --> 01:05:21.319
I'm sorry, Ji Ho.

1008
01:05:23.830 --> 01:05:25.330
I'm sorry, Hyuk.

1009
01:05:36.199 --> 01:05:37.639
Mother.

1010
01:05:39.409 --> 01:05:41.009
Father.

1011
01:05:43.509 --> 01:05:44.949
I'm sorry.

1012
01:05:50.190 --> 01:05:51.790
Do Kyung.

1013
01:06:00.099 --> 01:06:01.299
I...

1014
01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:04.529
can't forgive myself.

1015
01:06:20.553 --> 01:06:25.553
<font face="Papyrus" color="#ff8000">Subtitle ripped and resynced by redixion</font>

1016
01:06:42.599 --> 01:06:44.940
(My Golden Life)

1017
01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:46.980
It's been four days.

1018
01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:49.239
It's dangerous because she's in shock.

1019
01:06:49.239 --> 01:06:51.949
Ji An is not the person to stay out of touch.

1020
01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:54.580
You should read books instead of watching TV.

1021
01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:56.219
I don't like books.

1022
01:06:56.219 --> 01:06:58.119
Are you getting mad at us?

1023
01:06:58.119 --> 01:07:00.119
Your parents lost me.

1024
01:07:00.119 --> 01:07:01.460
It was an accident.

1025
01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:02.590
You call that an accident?

1026
01:07:02.590 --> 01:07:04.529
Why would you worry about Ji An?

1027
01:07:04.529 --> 01:07:05.960
She's not even your sister.

1028
01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:08.000
Where are you, Seo Ji An?

1029
01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.830
Tell me if you've talked to Ji An,

1030
01:07:09.830 --> 01:07:11.400
- or if you met her. - Who are you?

1031
01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:13.170
Is that a yes or a no?

1032
01:07:13.170 --> 01:07:14.170
I don't know.

1033
01:07:14.170 --> 01:07:15.299
Sunwoo Hyuk.
