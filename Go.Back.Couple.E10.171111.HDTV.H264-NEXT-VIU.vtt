3
00:00:08.873 --> 00:00:11.272
(2004, Newlywed days)

4
00:00:11.272 --> 00:00:12.713
This is...

5
00:00:13.272 --> 00:00:15.342
too strong, so I'll take it out.

6
00:00:15.342 --> 00:00:16.413
Let's see.

7
00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:18.683
This will damage her stomach,

8
00:00:18.683 --> 00:00:19.753
so that's gone too.

9
00:00:22.552 --> 00:00:25.192
The rest of them seems all right.

10
00:00:25.192 --> 00:00:26.692
Okay.

11
00:00:27.922 --> 00:00:28.962
What are you doing?

12
00:00:29.063 --> 00:00:30.063
Me?

13
00:00:30.392 --> 00:00:32.032
I left only the pill that you really need,

14
00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:33.362
so take only these.

15
00:00:33.902 --> 00:00:36.063
It'll be worse for you to develop a tolerance to these.

16
00:00:36.063 --> 00:00:37.072
Okay?

17
00:00:37.873 --> 00:00:40.943
Honey, you're the only one who cares about my health.

18
00:00:41.642 --> 00:00:42.902
You're better than my doctor.

19
00:00:42.902 --> 00:00:44.373
Of course.

20
00:00:44.373 --> 00:00:47.513
A doctor is someone who cares for your immediate pain.

21
00:00:48.013 --> 00:00:50.383
I'm someone who will be with you for life.

22
00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:51.752
Right?

23
00:00:53.652 --> 00:00:55.222
Thank you.

24
00:00:55.282 --> 00:00:57.993
Don't mention it.

25
00:00:57.993 --> 00:00:59.493
That was pretty cool.

26
00:00:59.493 --> 00:01:00.722
- Was it? - Yes.

27
00:01:01.362 --> 00:01:05.193
(Year 2017)

28
00:01:05.193 --> 00:01:06.633
You said you have anemia again.

29
00:01:07.462 --> 00:01:09.062
- Yes. - I took out...

30
00:01:09.062 --> 00:01:11.432
all the pills that give you anemia, so take this.

31
00:01:14.202 --> 00:01:15.202
Are you listening to me?

32
00:01:15.943 --> 00:01:17.173
Okay.

33
00:01:17.643 --> 00:01:20.842
At one point in life, we begin to take somethings for granted...

34
00:01:20.842 --> 00:01:22.783
because we get comfortable and used to them.

35
00:01:23.042 --> 00:01:24.182
Hey, wait.

36
00:01:24.553 --> 00:01:25.583
Take that shirt off.

37
00:01:25.583 --> 00:01:26.822
The cuffs are dirty.

38
00:01:26.822 --> 00:01:28.283
Come in, and get changed.

39
00:01:28.283 --> 00:01:29.482
It's too troublesome.

40
00:01:29.482 --> 00:01:31.652
It's okay to wear the same shirt for two days.

41
00:01:31.723 --> 00:01:33.923
People will talk if they see that.

42
00:01:33.923 --> 00:01:35.493
Why would you wear that...

43
00:01:35.493 --> 00:01:36.592
when you have a clean shirt here?

44
00:01:36.592 --> 00:01:37.762
Come back in.

45
00:01:37.833 --> 00:01:39.292
- Come on. - I...

46
00:01:39.292 --> 00:01:40.533
I'm late...

47
00:01:41.762 --> 00:01:43.633
- We live on considering... - Darn it.

48
00:01:43.633 --> 00:01:45.102
the kindness of our love...

49
00:01:45.232 --> 00:01:47.372
and the happiness I have...

50
00:01:47.572 --> 00:01:49.673
are something I deserve and took them for granted.

51
00:01:54.883 --> 00:01:56.783
Mom, come on.

52
00:01:58.852 --> 00:02:00.053
We're late.

53
00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:15.363
But we only realize this...

54
00:02:15.363 --> 00:02:16.833
after we lose everything.

55
00:02:17.833 --> 00:02:19.703
Even someone's existence itself...

56
00:02:20.402 --> 00:02:21.402
was not...

57
00:02:22.073 --> 00:02:23.643
supposed to be taken for granted.

58
00:02:25.273 --> 00:02:31.652
(Episode 10, You can't take anything for granted.)

59
00:02:33.752 --> 00:02:38.553
(Year 1999, Gangneung)

60
00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:51.902
What's with you?

61
00:02:51.972 --> 00:02:53.203
You're up early.

62
00:02:53.203 --> 00:02:54.273
You're up.

63
00:02:58.643 --> 00:03:00.282
Gosh, I couldn't sleep...

64
00:03:00.282 --> 00:03:01.543
because I didn't want to waste time.

65
00:03:11.222 --> 00:03:12.722
Do you remember this place?

66
00:03:15.023 --> 00:03:16.662
Somewhat.

67
00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:22.763
Weren't there fireflies around here?

68
00:03:24.532 --> 00:03:25.573
Is that so?

69
00:03:28.543 --> 00:03:30.043
I heard you were looking for me last night.

70
00:03:30.173 --> 00:03:31.173
Yes.

71
00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:34.842
Did you go somewhere?

72
00:03:35.782 --> 00:03:38.853
Yes, I went out for a walk.

73
00:03:39.282 --> 00:03:41.722
I'm not sure if the air is fresh because it's the countryside...

74
00:03:41.722 --> 00:03:43.323
or because it's in the past.

75
00:03:46.293 --> 00:03:47.293
Do you like it?

76
00:03:48.962 --> 00:03:50.793
Yes, I do.

77
00:03:52.493 --> 00:03:54.203
That's good, then.

78
00:03:55.032 --> 00:03:56.032
What's good?

79
00:03:56.333 --> 00:03:58.532
In the end, you saw them, so that's good.

80
00:03:59.203 --> 00:04:00.703
And I'm glad you like the air.

81
00:04:36.473 --> 00:04:37.572
What are you doing, Sul?

82
00:04:38.512 --> 00:04:41.743
Oh, I was organizing the things in the car.

83
00:04:42.283 --> 00:04:44.582
Sul, you're so organized. Thanks.

84
00:04:44.582 --> 00:04:47.423
It looked like you were really drunk yesterday.

85
00:04:47.423 --> 00:04:49.353
I hope you didn't get into any trouble again.

86
00:04:49.882 --> 00:04:52.053
I never cause any trouble.

87
00:04:52.192 --> 00:04:53.562
I shouldn't be asking you.

88
00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:55.522
Hey, both of you. Make sure you check...

89
00:04:55.522 --> 00:04:56.522
if everything is fine.

90
00:04:56.522 --> 00:04:57.733
See if anything is broken.

91
00:04:57.733 --> 00:04:58.733
What's he saying?

92
00:04:59.163 --> 00:05:01.332
It looks like we were good.

93
00:05:05.272 --> 00:05:06.533
Let's eat.

94
00:05:07.173 --> 00:05:08.343
What's all this?

95
00:05:08.343 --> 00:05:09.372
Before we go,

96
00:05:09.372 --> 00:05:12.072
can you call the kids and... Wait, what? 3, 6, 9...

97
00:05:12.072 --> 00:05:13.113
What's with my phone?

98
00:05:14.243 --> 00:05:15.283
Three...

99
00:05:24.493 --> 00:05:26.892
I feel bad for you guys too.

100
00:05:26.963 --> 00:05:28.822
I'll free you.

101
00:05:29.493 --> 00:05:30.493
One.

102
00:05:33.293 --> 00:05:34.303
Two.

103
00:05:37.733 --> 00:05:38.903
Seven.

104
00:05:41.173 --> 00:05:42.343
Chun Sul.

105
00:05:42.543 --> 00:05:44.512
I have no idea why I did that.

106
00:05:44.512 --> 00:05:45.913
I didn't do that on purpose.

107
00:05:45.913 --> 00:05:47.283
What is with you?

108
00:05:47.283 --> 00:05:48.483
Why?

109
00:05:48.483 --> 00:05:50.582
Come here. Hey!

110
00:05:50.783 --> 00:05:52.553
Come back here! You!

111
00:05:52.812 --> 00:05:54.283
You!

112
00:05:56.622 --> 00:05:58.522
They might end up dating. They're a good match.

113
00:05:58.892 --> 00:06:00.723
Sul can do much better.

114
00:06:01.822 --> 00:06:03.562
Give that to me!

115
00:06:04.363 --> 00:06:05.432
You're right.

116
00:06:13.442 --> 00:06:14.442
Hey.

117
00:06:15.843 --> 00:06:17.572
You didn't shave yourself clean again.

118
00:06:18.413 --> 00:06:21.413
Goodness, you and your impatience.

119
00:06:21.642 --> 00:06:23.142
It's not that I didn't want to.

120
00:06:23.142 --> 00:06:25.012
This age doesn't have a six-blade razor.

121
00:06:25.012 --> 00:06:26.682
The razor isn't good enough.

122
00:06:26.723 --> 00:06:27.983
People who can't do it right...

123
00:06:27.983 --> 00:06:29.952
always blames the equipment.

124
00:06:30.252 --> 00:06:32.053
The six-blade razor.

125
00:06:32.053 --> 00:06:33.053
Hey...

126
00:06:40.603 --> 00:06:44.372
Goodness, Jin Joo is always so worried about me.

127
00:06:44.903 --> 00:06:46.372
Jin Joo!

128
00:06:46.843 --> 00:06:50.272
I'll shave myself clean next time, okay?

129
00:06:57.882 --> 00:06:59.512
I'll see you at school.

130
00:06:59.682 --> 00:07:01.783
- Okay, sure. - Hurry up and get in.

131
00:07:05.392 --> 00:07:07.463
Drive safely, and see you at school.

132
00:07:08.293 --> 00:07:09.293
What?

133
00:07:10.632 --> 00:07:11.632
Sure.

134
00:07:12.562 --> 00:07:13.562
What's going on?

135
00:07:13.562 --> 00:07:14.803
Oh, we have too much stuff,

136
00:07:14.803 --> 00:07:16.163
so we don't have a seat for you.

137
00:07:16.432 --> 00:07:18.132
What are you talking about? We put everything in...

138
00:07:18.132 --> 00:07:20.142
Gosh, I was still talking.

139
00:07:20.473 --> 00:07:22.343
Jin Joo, we have too much stuff here,

140
00:07:22.343 --> 00:07:24.113
so you should get a ride from Nam Gil.

141
00:07:24.113 --> 00:07:25.413
Please give her a ride, Nam Gil.

142
00:07:25.543 --> 00:07:27.413
Hey, what are you talking about? We do have a seat.

143
00:07:27.413 --> 00:07:29.043
Jin Joo, get in.

144
00:07:29.043 --> 00:07:30.213
We do have a seat.

145
00:07:30.213 --> 00:07:32.952
Yes, it'll be boring to drive all by himself.

146
00:07:33.182 --> 00:07:34.653
He can use someone to talk to.

147
00:07:35.053 --> 00:07:37.322
He doesn't need anyone to talk to.

148
00:07:37.322 --> 00:07:38.522
He's not an old man.

149
00:07:38.522 --> 00:07:40.622
Jin Joo, get in.

150
00:07:58.142 --> 00:07:59.142
Hey.

151
00:07:59.213 --> 00:08:01.843
Why did you bring back the stuff that were in the trunk?

152
00:08:01.882 --> 00:08:02.913
He's right.

153
00:08:02.913 --> 00:08:04.353
We could've made a seat for Jin Joo.

154
00:08:04.353 --> 00:08:05.613
The trunk is completely empty.

155
00:08:05.613 --> 00:08:08.423
Gosh, you fools.

156
00:08:08.452 --> 00:08:10.593
Great job, Sul.

157
00:08:10.822 --> 00:08:12.252
You're like Cupid.

158
00:08:12.252 --> 00:08:13.493
You were born with the talent.

159
00:08:14.163 --> 00:08:15.863
Jin Joo should meet a good guy for once...

160
00:08:15.863 --> 00:08:17.093
to be happy.

161
00:08:17.093 --> 00:08:18.293
She's still young.

162
00:08:18.293 --> 00:08:19.692
Yes, for once.

163
00:08:21.533 --> 00:08:22.832
Wait, did she date anyone else before?

164
00:09:14.983 --> 00:09:16.052
These are...

165
00:09:43.983 --> 00:09:46.652
There are so many fireflies,

166
00:09:47.122 --> 00:09:48.183
aren't there?

167
00:09:49.552 --> 00:09:50.593
Well...

168
00:09:51.152 --> 00:09:52.593
Shall we go back now?

169
00:09:54.662 --> 00:09:56.223
We should drink.

170
00:09:56.662 --> 00:09:57.693
Alcohol.

171
00:09:57.693 --> 00:09:59.392
Let's go drink.

172
00:10:11.412 --> 00:10:12.473
Thanks.

173
00:10:12.943 --> 00:10:14.012
Pardon?

174
00:10:14.213 --> 00:10:15.613
Thanks for coming with me.

175
00:10:18.613 --> 00:10:20.122
Don't mention it.

176
00:10:20.782 --> 00:10:22.752
Driving a long distance...

177
00:10:22.752 --> 00:10:24.922
makes you tired and drowsy.

178
00:10:25.922 --> 00:10:27.823
Thanks to you I'm getting a comfortable ride.

179
00:10:30.733 --> 00:10:31.792
Well...

180
00:10:32.792 --> 00:10:34.833
Is it clean?

181
00:10:36.233 --> 00:10:38.073
What? What's clean?

182
00:10:39.372 --> 00:10:41.642
I'm not sure if I'm clean shaven.

183
00:10:42.973 --> 00:10:44.772
Shaving? Let me see.

184
00:10:50.353 --> 00:10:51.613
Yes, it's clean.

185
00:10:53.683 --> 00:10:54.853
Really?

186
00:10:57.792 --> 00:10:58.922
I see.

187
00:11:02.063 --> 00:11:03.323
If you're tired, take a nap.

188
00:11:04.733 --> 00:11:07.563
I'd be ill-manner to sleep next to a driver.

189
00:11:07.703 --> 00:11:09.032
You'll get sleepy too.

190
00:11:10.002 --> 00:11:11.203
I'm fine.

191
00:11:17.613 --> 00:11:20.213
A massive number of people gathered...

192
00:11:20.213 --> 00:11:22.282
at Gimpo Airport this afternoon where the the King of Pop..

193
00:11:22.282 --> 00:11:23.983
Michael Jackson arrived.

194
00:11:25.152 --> 00:11:27.453
That amazing figure actually came to Korea.

195
00:11:27.622 --> 00:11:28.723
I know.

196
00:11:28.723 --> 00:11:31.622
They say a singer like that is only born once in a century.

197
00:11:32.422 --> 00:11:35.863
It's incredible to live in the same era as him.

198
00:11:37.493 --> 00:11:38.833
Incredible?

199
00:11:39.993 --> 00:11:42.162
You're more incredible to me, Mom.

200
00:11:44.203 --> 00:11:47.272
These days you only say the nicest things.

201
00:12:01.652 --> 00:12:03.993
Like this. Is it like this?

202
00:12:03.993 --> 00:12:05.152
Is it like this?

203
00:12:05.622 --> 00:12:06.723
I think I can do it.

204
00:12:11.233 --> 00:12:14.603
- Like this. - Gosh.

205
00:12:14.703 --> 00:12:17.372
- Like this. - Goodness.

206
00:12:17.433 --> 00:12:19.333
Right?

207
00:12:20.272 --> 00:12:22.243
- Like this. - Yes, like this.

208
00:12:22.343 --> 00:12:23.473
- Right? - Gosh.

209
00:12:23.943 --> 00:12:25.042
You're good.

210
00:12:26.412 --> 00:12:27.813
Not like this.

211
00:12:28.943 --> 00:12:30.012
Then like this?

212
00:12:30.313 --> 00:12:32.213
Are you riding a bike?

213
00:12:32.453 --> 00:12:35.282
Like so.

214
00:12:41.323 --> 00:12:42.823
I'm doing it, right?

215
00:12:53.802 --> 00:12:54.902
Drink this before you go.

216
00:12:59.912 --> 00:13:01.512
Why didn't you use a blender?

217
00:13:01.512 --> 00:13:04.613
And why did you peel the carrots? It's too much work.

218
00:13:04.983 --> 00:13:06.953
It's not delicious when I use the blender.

219
00:13:06.983 --> 00:13:09.823
You and Eun Joo don't like the peels in your juice.

220
00:13:09.823 --> 00:13:10.993
That's why peeled them.

221
00:13:15.693 --> 00:13:16.762
It's good.

222
00:13:23.933 --> 00:13:25.002
It's delicious.

223
00:13:26.103 --> 00:13:27.772
Eun Joo, drink this before you go.

224
00:13:28.642 --> 00:13:30.542
No, I'm not hungry.

225
00:13:31.912 --> 00:13:33.382
Drink it.

226
00:13:33.512 --> 00:13:34.983
Force it down.

227
00:13:35.213 --> 00:13:37.183
You shouldn't skip breakfast.

228
00:13:37.183 --> 00:13:39.282
- I said I don't want it. - Goodness.

229
00:13:39.853 --> 00:13:41.052
Why you...

230
00:13:43.122 --> 00:13:44.922
- Mom, see you. - Bye.

231
00:13:47.292 --> 00:13:48.392
Goodness.

232
00:13:50.863 --> 00:13:51.892
Ma Eun Joo.

233
00:13:53.902 --> 00:13:55.162
Don't call me like that.

234
00:13:56.103 --> 00:13:57.272
We need to talk.

235
00:13:58.532 --> 00:13:59.573
About what?

236
00:14:01.402 --> 00:14:03.302
Hey, I'm your older sister.

237
00:14:03.713 --> 00:14:05.213
You should talk to me nicely.

238
00:14:06.042 --> 00:14:07.213
Okay, Eun Joo.

239
00:14:11.912 --> 00:14:14.422
All right, that's better.

240
00:14:16.382 --> 00:14:17.622
What is it?

241
00:14:18.693 --> 00:14:20.392
Can't you be nicer to Mom?

242
00:14:21.093 --> 00:14:23.193
I'm saying this because I'm really worried about you.

243
00:14:24.162 --> 00:14:25.292
What are you saying?

244
00:14:28.963 --> 00:14:32.302
Do you think Mom will be with us forever?

245
00:14:33.772 --> 00:14:34.802
No.

246
00:14:35.603 --> 00:14:37.672
You sound like an old lady. What's wrong with you?

247
00:14:41.012 --> 00:14:42.683
Nobody else in the world...

248
00:14:43.282 --> 00:14:47.183
but Mom would peel carrots to make juice,

249
00:14:48.323 --> 00:14:49.752
and prepare breakfast for us.

250
00:14:52.122 --> 00:14:54.022
There's nobody else but my mom.

251
00:14:54.392 --> 00:14:55.823
Do you think your husband will do that for you?

252
00:14:56.323 --> 00:14:57.433
Or your children?

253
00:14:59.032 --> 00:15:00.063
Hey.

254
00:15:00.302 --> 00:15:02.002
Are you worried that Mom would pass away?

255
00:15:04.032 --> 00:15:08.703
There is nothing in this world that can't happen to us.

256
00:15:13.213 --> 00:15:14.683
I don't want you to regret it later.

257
00:15:24.892 --> 00:15:26.152
Don't cry.

258
00:15:26.493 --> 00:15:28.622
Eun Joo.

259
00:15:29.463 --> 00:15:31.532
Don't cry.

260
00:15:33.032 --> 00:15:34.132
Eun Joo...

261
00:15:50.412 --> 00:15:51.713
What's wrong with you today?

262
00:16:05.162 --> 00:16:06.463
Time slip.

263
00:16:07.302 --> 00:16:08.333
Earthquake?

264
00:16:13.073 --> 00:16:14.103
Yes.

265
00:16:14.402 --> 00:16:16.172
Not the earthquake records, but predictions.

266
00:16:16.843 --> 00:16:18.713
When will there be another earthquake in Seoul?

267
00:16:19.343 --> 00:16:21.713
He's calling the National Weather Service, right?

268
00:16:22.213 --> 00:16:24.713
This isn't Japan. Why would Korea have an earthquake?

269
00:16:25.713 --> 00:16:28.083
I thought he was back to normal,

270
00:16:28.083 --> 00:16:30.622
but he's back to acting all crazy and weird again.

271
00:16:32.453 --> 00:16:33.493
You don't know?

272
00:16:36.122 --> 00:16:37.193
Okay.

273
00:16:38.433 --> 00:16:40.203
Why isn't anyone prepared?

274
00:16:40.203 --> 00:16:41.863
There's no place on earth that is safe from earthquakes.

275
00:16:42.402 --> 00:16:44.802
Why do people come to senses only after a disaster happens?

276
00:16:47.042 --> 00:16:49.402
- Where are you going? - Library.

277
00:16:50.012 --> 00:16:51.073
Library?

278
00:16:52.843 --> 00:16:54.012
He really is crazy.

("Is Everything Determined?" by Stephen Hawking)

281
00:17:03.392 --> 00:17:05.223
Based on a scientific theory,

282
00:17:05.223 --> 00:17:07.262
Stephen Hawking described that it was possible...

283
00:17:07.262 --> 00:17:09.522
to travel back in time and correct your past.

284
00:17:09.993 --> 00:17:12.233
He asserts that time travelling is possible...

285
00:17:12.332 --> 00:17:15.463
through warping of the space-time.

286
00:17:17.633 --> 00:17:18.733

290
00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:32.153
Where is she?

291
00:17:49.332 --> 00:17:50.473
What are you having...

292
00:17:50.572 --> 00:17:51.873
alone?

293
00:17:52.173 --> 00:17:53.272
It's my breakfast.

294
00:17:54.743 --> 00:17:56.272
What about you? Is that your breakfast?

295
00:18:00.042 --> 00:18:02.042
There's a cat I know that comes here.

296
00:18:02.743 --> 00:18:03.883
But today...

297
00:18:05.282 --> 00:18:06.352
you are here.

298
00:18:07.082 --> 00:18:09.453
Is that for that cat? Is it a stray cat?

299
00:18:09.883 --> 00:18:10.923
Yes.

300
00:18:11.092 --> 00:18:13.792
Maybe she's lost. Maybe something happened to her.

301
00:18:15.223 --> 00:18:17.193
She's always crying...

302
00:18:18.233 --> 00:18:19.362
like someone.

303
00:18:20.163 --> 00:18:21.332
Like who?

304
00:18:27.973 --> 00:18:29.173
Goodness.

305
00:18:29.243 --> 00:18:32.173
Your stomach is telling me you want to eat this.

306
00:18:32.542 --> 00:18:33.612
Gosh.

307
00:18:37.183 --> 00:18:38.282
Here.

308
00:18:38.512 --> 00:18:40.953
You should feed yourself before you feed the cat.

309
00:18:41.653 --> 00:18:43.822
No. I don't usually eat breakfast.

310
00:18:48.022 --> 00:18:50.092
I don't believe that. So eat this.

311
00:18:50.393 --> 00:18:53.133
You shouldn't skip breakfast. Students need energy to study.

312
00:18:55.062 --> 00:18:56.733
I'm taking this not because I want it,

313
00:18:57.673 --> 00:18:59.133
but because you gave it to me.

314
00:19:00.643 --> 00:19:02.002
Okay.

315
00:19:02.673 --> 00:19:03.943
Eat up.

316
00:19:04.812 --> 00:19:05.842
Goodness.

317
00:19:13.653 --> 00:19:14.782
You're eating well.

318
00:19:15.423 --> 00:19:16.423
It's delicious.

319
00:19:28.703 --> 00:19:29.762
Are you hurt?

320
00:19:30.502 --> 00:19:32.173
No, it's nothing.

321
00:19:33.072 --> 00:19:35.173
You should go first. I need a moment.

322
00:19:35.772 --> 00:19:36.812
What's wrong?

323
00:19:57.733 --> 00:19:59.592
She's going to be in pain for a while.

324
00:20:02.433 --> 00:20:05.072
Gosh, I don't have any.

325
00:20:06.233 --> 00:20:07.542
Gosh, how can this be?

326
00:20:08.042 --> 00:20:09.943
What should I do?

327
00:20:11.272 --> 00:20:12.342
I'm in a big trouble.

328
00:20:21.552 --> 00:20:22.623
Thanks.

329
00:20:25.123 --> 00:20:26.822
I want to go there again.

330
00:20:27.193 --> 00:20:29.292
- I miss the beach. - The roasted clam.

331
00:20:29.663 --> 00:20:30.862

332
00:20:31.092 --> 00:20:32.233
Gosh.

Why aren't they picking up?

335
00:20:40.973 --> 00:20:42.802
Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

336
00:20:54.153 --> 00:20:55.822
Give me a medicine that eases cramps.

337
00:20:56.923 --> 00:20:57.993
This works well.

338
00:21:02.923 --> 00:21:04.933
She has a weak stomach.

339
00:21:04.933 --> 00:21:07.133
I need one with acetaminophen,

340
00:21:07.203 --> 00:21:08.903
not ibuprofen.

341
00:21:11.602 --> 00:21:12.703
Wait a moment.

342
00:21:15.842 --> 00:21:16.842
Here.

Thank you.

00:21:22.512 --> 00:21:23.713
Wait a moment.

345
00:21:26.453 --> 00:21:28.883
- Hello? - It's me.

346
00:21:29.752 --> 00:21:32.923
Can you buy me one of those?

347
00:21:34.022 --> 00:21:35.123
I will.

348
00:21:37.032 --> 00:21:38.032
Wait a moment.

349
00:21:40.663 --> 00:21:41.802
I'll have this one too.

350
00:21:42.933 --> 00:21:44.002
This one too?

351
00:21:46.433 --> 00:21:47.542
Yes, all right.

352
00:21:47.943 --> 00:21:50.042
Wait a moment.

353
00:21:50.473 --> 00:21:51.913
This one's not wing-shaped.

354
00:21:52.342 --> 00:21:53.413
Wait a moment.

355
00:21:57.483 --> 00:21:58.512
I'll have this one.

356
00:21:59.012 --> 00:22:00.252
- This one? - Yes.

357
00:22:01.683 --> 00:22:03.552
How much is it? Thank you.

358
00:22:04.822 --> 00:22:07.322
(Pharmacy)

359
00:22:08.562 --> 00:22:11.092
Choi Ban Do is probably sleeping in the library...

360
00:22:11.133 --> 00:22:13.032
so that he can skip class.

361
00:22:13.903 --> 00:22:15.062
- Hey. - What?

362
00:22:15.933 --> 00:22:17.373
He's over there.

363
00:22:18.532 --> 00:22:20.102
What is he doing there?

364
00:22:20.302 --> 00:22:21.973
How can anyone sleep at the construction site?

365
00:22:21.973 --> 00:22:24.913
I know, right? We're probably the first ones to do that.

366
00:22:37.292 --> 00:22:38.623
Gosh.

367
00:22:39.592 --> 00:22:42.362
Hey, Ma... Ma Jin Joo.

368
00:22:50.133 --> 00:22:52.002
How can I get inside?

369
00:22:54.342 --> 00:22:55.973
What are you doing here, pervert?

370
00:23:10.252 --> 00:23:12.852
This scum must be troubled with his sexuality.

371
00:23:12.852 --> 00:23:14.362
Is this yours?

372
00:23:14.362 --> 00:23:15.762
Gosh.

373
00:23:15.923 --> 00:23:18.163
Why would you push me like that?

374
00:23:18.433 --> 00:23:19.463
It's embarrassing.

375
00:23:22.663 --> 00:23:24.802
It's wing-shaped.

376
00:23:32.143 --> 00:23:33.612
What's this? Is this a challenge?

377
00:23:33.612 --> 00:23:34.782
Hey!

378
00:23:36.812 --> 00:23:38.653
Don't look at me like that.

379
00:23:39.582 --> 00:23:41.623
Ma Jin Joo is inside. Give it to her.

380
00:23:42.552 --> 00:23:43.552
What?

381
00:23:49.463 --> 00:23:51.393
I can't figure him out.

382
00:23:57.903 --> 00:23:59.133
Go Dok Jae.

383
00:23:59.772 --> 00:24:01.743
Gosh, that was so embarrassing.

384
00:24:02.643 --> 00:24:03.873
Gosh.

385
00:24:07.713 --> 00:24:08.842
Are you in a lot of pain?

386
00:24:08.842 --> 00:24:10.213
Should we buy you something?

387
00:24:11.453 --> 00:24:13.082
No, it's fine.

388
00:24:13.483 --> 00:24:15.123
Go, and eat.

389
00:24:15.282 --> 00:24:16.383
Are you sure?

390
00:24:17.752 --> 00:24:20.062
Then take a rest here. We'll be quick.

391
00:24:20.292 --> 00:24:21.393
All right.

392
00:24:21.393 --> 00:24:22.822
You should take your time.

393
00:24:22.822 --> 00:24:23.963
I'm fine.

394
00:24:24.032 --> 00:24:25.963
- We'll be back soon. - Bye.

395
00:24:48.082 --> 00:24:49.183
Hey.

396
00:24:50.993 --> 00:24:52.493
I knew you'd be like that.

397
00:24:53.193 --> 00:24:55.822
How many times do I need to tell you you should take pills with water?

398
00:24:57.193 --> 00:24:59.332
Stop telling me what to do like an old man.

399
00:24:59.332 --> 00:25:00.832
You are worse.

400
00:25:03.673 --> 00:25:04.733
Are you all right?

401
00:25:05.403 --> 00:25:06.802
Do I look all right?

402
00:25:06.802 --> 00:25:08.403
It hurts so much.

403
00:25:19.153 --> 00:25:20.923
Rest your face here.

404
00:25:27.423 --> 00:25:28.963
Gosh, it's fine.

405
00:25:29.423 --> 00:25:30.592
Someone might see us.

406
00:25:30.592 --> 00:25:32.062
So what if someone sees us?

407
00:25:32.062 --> 00:25:33.262
Did we commit a crime or something?

408
00:25:43.612 --> 00:25:44.943
Shall we kiss?

409
00:25:45.713 --> 00:25:46.713
Are you out of your mind?

410
00:25:48.713 --> 00:25:50.483
This is something...

411
00:25:50.483 --> 00:25:52.413
we should feel guilty about.

412
00:25:52.413 --> 00:25:55.723
Gosh, you're acting like such an old man.

413
00:25:57.623 --> 00:25:59.193
I'm not the only one who's old.

414
00:25:59.453 --> 00:26:00.993
You're old too.

415
00:26:03.532 --> 00:26:04.532
I guess becoming younger...

416
00:26:04.532 --> 00:26:06.133
didn't take away your cramps.

417
00:26:06.133 --> 00:26:07.862
I may be younger, but I'm still a woman.

418
00:26:08.562 --> 00:26:09.562
You're right.

419
00:26:10.433 --> 00:26:13.102
If you keep taking pills, you'll become immune to it.

420
00:26:14.243 --> 00:26:16.542
This chronic disease doesn't seem to get better.

421
00:26:33.723 --> 00:26:34.723
Does it hurt?

422
00:26:35.193 --> 00:26:37.493
Yes, it hurts.

423

424
00:27:12.963 --> 00:27:14.032
Don't you have class?

425
00:27:14.302 --> 00:27:16.832
It's fine. I'm too old to take classes.

426
00:27:51.272 --> 00:27:52.832
Hey, let's have that one.

427
00:27:54.042 --> 00:27:55.873
- It's so cool. - It's great.

428
00:27:55.873 --> 00:27:57.572
- Did you see that? - Yes.

429
00:28:03.012 --> 00:28:05.812
High school students nowadays are so pretty.

430
00:28:06.653 --> 00:28:07.852
You're pretty too.

431
00:28:08.883 --> 00:28:09.883
What?

432
00:28:10.653 --> 00:28:12.653
You are 18 years younger.

433
00:28:12.653 --> 00:28:13.862
Of course you're pretty.

434
00:28:17.762 --> 00:28:18.933
Give me a cigarette.

435
00:28:19.362 --> 00:28:20.562
Be quiet.

436
00:28:20.562 --> 00:28:22.332
- You ask for one every time. - Just give me one.

437
00:28:22.332 --> 00:28:23.373
You should bring yours.

438
00:28:23.373 --> 00:28:25.633
- Yes. - Give one to him too.

439
00:28:25.633 --> 00:28:27.842
- All right. - I don't smoke this.

440
00:28:27.943 --> 00:28:29.643
I want to have my nails done.

441
00:28:30.342 --> 00:28:31.342
Your nails?

442
00:28:31.342 --> 00:28:32.473
- Gosh. - I'm sorry.

443
00:28:32.812 --> 00:28:34.713
Hey, look! I bought it.

444
00:28:34.713 --> 00:28:36.012
- Really? - It was a success.

445
00:28:38.953 --> 00:28:40.123
These scums...

446
00:28:40.123 --> 00:28:41.183
Hey.

447
00:28:41.453 --> 00:28:43.453
Don't. You'll get in trouble.

448
00:28:43.453 --> 00:28:44.623
Let's just go.

449
00:28:44.623 --> 00:28:46.322
No, if they start smoking,

450
00:28:46.322 --> 00:28:48.092
their lungs will rot.

451
00:28:48.092 --> 00:28:49.163
Please.

452
00:28:49.762 --> 00:28:52.163
You know how scary children are nowadays.

453
00:28:52.362 --> 00:28:54.332
You have a family now.

454
00:28:54.332 --> 00:28:56.302
You can't act like you aren't afraid of anything...

455
00:28:56.302 --> 00:28:57.633
like you did when you were young.

456
00:28:57.973 --> 00:29:00.203
If something happens to you, I'll become a widow.

457
00:29:00.302 --> 00:29:01.302
Remember that.

458
00:29:01.403 --> 00:29:02.703
Don't say that.

459
00:29:02.703 --> 00:29:04.143
Why would you say it like that?

460
00:29:04.143 --> 00:29:06.042
Let's go, okay?

461
00:29:06.342 --> 00:29:07.943
- All right. - Let's go.

462
00:29:07.943 --> 00:29:09.312
- Don't. - Gosh, these scums.

463
00:29:09.312 --> 00:29:10.953
- All right. - He doesn't smoke.

464
00:29:11.112 --> 00:29:12.213
Okay.

465
00:29:12.213 --> 00:29:14.223
Wasn't it weird during P.E.?

466
00:29:14.453 --> 00:29:16.953
Stop it. You guys always make fun of me.

467
00:29:16.953 --> 00:29:18.123
Because you made a mistake.

468
00:29:18.993 --> 00:29:21.362
- Darn it. - Look at your legs.

469
00:29:21.393 --> 00:29:23.163
What did I ever do to you?

470
00:29:29.633 --> 00:29:31.373
Hey, remember to breathe.

471
00:29:31.703 --> 00:29:32.802
You breathe.

472
00:29:38.413 --> 00:29:41.312
It doesn't matter if we have the body parts.

473
00:29:42.683 --> 00:29:44.352
We never made a use of it.

474
00:29:46.953 --> 00:29:48.223
I envy you.

475
00:29:48.483 --> 00:29:49.623
For what, you idiot?

476
00:29:51.252 --> 00:29:52.792
You have a girlfriend.

477
00:29:56.193 --> 00:29:57.292
You idiot.

478
00:29:58.493 --> 00:29:59.862
- Stop. - Why?

479
00:30:00.262 --> 00:30:02.403
Why did you stop it?

480
00:30:02.403 --> 00:30:03.832
You just imagined her, didn't you?

481
00:30:04.072 --> 00:30:05.302
Bo Reum isn't like that.

482
00:30:11.713 --> 00:30:12.772
Do you have the stuff?

483
00:30:17.483 --> 00:30:18.582
I do!

484
00:30:20.683 --> 00:30:21.883
What is it?

485
00:30:22.082 --> 00:30:23.183
Let's get ready.

486
00:30:24.052 --> 00:30:27.193
This isn't something you can watch every day.

487
00:30:27.822 --> 00:30:29.123
Okay, are you ready?

488
00:30:29.822 --> 00:30:30.963
Let's go.

489
00:30:43.973 --> 00:30:45.012
Hey.

490
00:30:45.812 --> 00:30:48.282
Is this supposed to be like this?

491
00:30:48.983 --> 00:30:52.153
Goodness, you kids. You're all so naive.

492
00:30:54.052 --> 00:30:56.052
What's that supposed to mean? It sounds like you know stuff.

493
00:30:56.453 --> 00:30:59.022
It's not that I sound like it. I do know this stuff.

494
00:31:00.292 --> 00:31:01.963
What? Wait.

495
00:31:02.463 --> 00:31:04.332
Haven't you done it yet? You even have a boyfriend.

496
00:31:05.633 --> 00:31:09.703
I see you're against premarital sex, that's so old-fashioned.

497
00:31:10.373 --> 00:31:11.973
Hey, no.

498
00:31:12.133 --> 00:31:13.602
What are you talking about?

499
00:31:15.502 --> 00:31:16.602
Hey.

500
00:31:16.602 --> 00:31:19.713
Bo Reum isn't a cultural asset. You don't have to protect her.

501
00:31:21.643 --> 00:31:23.143
I am going to protect her!

502
00:31:24.213 --> 00:31:27.082
Darn it, I can't even make use of myself.

503
00:31:28.552 --> 00:31:29.582
You're disgusting.

504
00:31:47.143 --> 00:31:50.072
The emperor of pop music, Michael Jackson's concert...

505
00:31:50.072 --> 00:31:51.973
in Korea will be held today.

506
00:31:52.643 --> 00:31:57.383
My heart flows away like the water

507
00:31:57.812 --> 00:32:02.953
Maybe I'll lie on the ocean to be a lonely water bird

508
00:32:03.252 --> 00:32:07.463
Does the port know the deep thoughts of the waves?

509
00:32:07.463 --> 00:32:08.562
Mom.

510
00:32:10.963 --> 00:32:12.193
Do you want to go to the karaoke?

511
00:32:13.032 --> 00:32:14.062
Right now?

512
00:32:14.433 --> 00:32:15.532
In the middle of the day?

513
00:32:16.772 --> 00:32:17.903
Are we going to the karaoke?

514
00:32:17.903 --> 00:32:19.072
I want to go too.

515
00:32:19.233 --> 00:32:20.502
What? Karaoke?

516
00:32:20.572 --> 00:32:21.743
Sounds great.

517
00:32:27.282 --> 00:32:29.512
Like this, this, and this.

518
00:32:29.782 --> 00:32:31.183
Let's go to the karaoke.

519
00:32:31.183 --> 00:32:33.153
Go, and get changed. And this!

520
00:32:33.153 --> 00:32:35.322
- Look at me. - Yes!

521
00:32:35.852 --> 00:32:37.223
Come on, Dad.

522
00:32:38.292 --> 00:32:40.423
- You're so good. - Like this, this.

523
00:32:42.092 --> 00:32:43.562
Dad, that hurts.

524
00:32:51.002 --> 00:32:53.673
(Ballet and B-boying)

525
00:32:57.842 --> 00:32:58.943
What's this?

526
00:32:58.943 --> 00:33:01.312
Do you remember the B-boys that I danced with before?

527
00:33:02.643 --> 00:33:06.153
Yes, the time when I pushed you, right?

528
00:33:06.822 --> 00:33:09.723
The same B-boys came to find me.

529
00:33:09.782 --> 00:33:10.993
They wanted to perform together.

530
00:33:11.723 --> 00:33:12.822
Really?

531
00:33:14.092 --> 00:33:15.623
Wow, that's awesome.

532
00:33:16.993 --> 00:33:18.092
I'm so glad.

533
00:33:18.532 --> 00:33:20.463
I'll continue to do ballet,

534
00:33:21.262 --> 00:33:22.762
and I want to perform with them too.

535
00:33:23.302 --> 00:33:24.403
Come, and watch us.

536
00:33:24.873 --> 00:33:26.703
Of course. Of course, I'll be there.

537
00:33:26.973 --> 00:33:28.072
Remember.

538
00:33:28.072 --> 00:33:30.243
I helped you get this gig. Don't you forget.

539
00:33:31.473 --> 00:33:32.612
I know.

540
00:33:39.282 --> 00:33:40.453
It's tomorrow.

541
00:33:52.493 --> 00:33:53.663
Hello?

542
00:33:53.663 --> 00:33:54.762
Ban Do, where are you?

543
00:33:55.433 --> 00:33:58.673
Me? Seo Young has a show, so I'm on my way to see that.

544
00:33:59.133 --> 00:34:02.243
Darn it, Jae Woo is on a date too. I'm really bored.

545
00:34:02.243 --> 00:34:03.913
I'm so bored.

546
00:34:04.373 --> 00:34:05.473
Darn you.

547
00:34:11.683 --> 00:34:12.782
My gosh.

548
00:34:12.853 --> 00:34:15.152
Hi. Are you going somewhere?

549
00:34:15.152 --> 00:34:16.723
Oh, hello.

550
00:34:17.253 --> 00:34:18.393
Yes.

551
00:34:18.393 --> 00:34:20.023
To some place. Right now.

552
00:34:20.023 --> 00:34:22.462
Yes, I have to go. Goodbye.

553
00:34:30.632 --> 00:34:32.132
What is this? Why is she following me?

554
00:34:33.203 --> 00:34:34.273
Darn it.

555
00:34:43.183 --> 00:34:44.282
Oh, right.

556
00:34:44.282 --> 00:34:46.612
That girl who was with you. Ma Jin Joo from history major.

557
00:34:47.023 --> 00:34:48.253
Is she okay?

558
00:34:50.393 --> 00:34:53.052
I heard this from the medical students.

559
00:34:53.762 --> 00:34:57.462
It looked like Hyun Seok found her that day and harassed her.

560
00:34:58.132 --> 00:34:59.563
I heard he hit her.

561
00:35:03.103 --> 00:35:04.703
All right! We're at a karaoke.

562
00:35:04.773 --> 00:35:07.273
I guess these places are still around.

563
00:35:08.842 --> 00:35:10.373
Why isn't Jin Joo coming?

564
00:35:10.543 --> 00:35:11.873
You're right. Where is she?

565
00:35:13.683 --> 00:35:15.243
Ta-da.

566
00:35:15.982 --> 00:35:17.183
Goodness.

567
00:35:17.212 --> 00:35:19.253
We can't sing without some beer.

568
00:35:19.353 --> 00:35:21.223
- Wow. - A midday drink.

569
00:35:21.253 --> 00:35:24.523
Wow, Jin Joo. You're ready to have some fun.

570
00:35:24.523 --> 00:35:27.862
- This doesn't happen every day. - One for you.

571
00:35:28.063 --> 00:35:29.393
Mom, sing something first.

572
00:35:29.422 --> 00:35:31.393
What's with you?

573
00:35:31.793 --> 00:35:33.532
I can't sing in the middle of the day.

574
00:35:33.532 --> 00:35:35.362
My voice is gone. I can't sing.

575
00:35:35.433 --> 00:35:36.532
You should sing.

576
00:35:36.632 --> 00:35:37.632
Come on.

577
00:35:37.632 --> 00:35:38.873
Honey, you can do it.

578
00:35:38.933 --> 00:35:40.543
Let's make a toast.

579
00:35:40.603 --> 00:35:42.072
- Okay, then. - All right.

580
00:35:42.243 --> 00:35:44.612
- Cheers. - Cheers.

My dear, will you leave me?

587
00:36:23.782 --> 00:36:30.322
After you gave me so much sorrow

588
00:36:32.123 --> 00:36:37.333
Can you not love me?

589
00:36:37.433 --> 00:36:40.962
I really love you

591
00:36:44.433 --> 00:36:48.003

What is wrong with you?

598
00:37:30.882 --> 00:37:33.583
Do you think I let you win before because I'm that weak?

599
00:37:34.753 --> 00:37:35.882
How dare you touch her?

600
00:37:36.282 --> 00:37:37.592
How dare you touch her?

601
00:37:39.692 --> 00:37:41.523
How dare you?

602
00:37:44.362 --> 00:37:45.493
How...

603
00:37:46.333 --> 00:37:47.433
dare you?

604
00:37:47.703 --> 00:37:49.402
You should be happy that I'm not Doctor Park.

605
00:37:49.902 --> 00:37:52.703
Does he still make you manage his mistresses?

606
00:37:53.743 --> 00:37:54.973
Well, I guess so.

607
00:37:55.773 --> 00:37:57.043
That really hurts.

608
00:37:58.112 --> 00:38:00.043
Oh, I didn't do that on purpose.

609

Are you insane?

610
00:38:03.583 --> 00:38:04.982
How dare you touch her?

611

How dare you touch her?

612
00:38:10.853 --> 00:38:12.692
I really like you.

Darn it.

615
00:38:16.732 --> 00:38:17.993
If you keep doing this,

616
00:38:18.132 --> 00:38:19.993
I'm going to cut off all of your medicine.

617
00:38:20.262 --> 00:38:21.402
I'm sorry.

618
00:38:23.873 --> 00:38:25.302
Keep it up, okay?

619
00:38:27.973 --> 00:38:29.072
I'm sorry.

dare you?

00:41:05.833 --> 00:41:07.333

00:41:25.652 --> 00:41:28.322
I guess he didn't fight back because he did something wrong.

653
00:41:28.322 --> 00:41:29.953
Just when I thought you were done being crazy,

654

you go ahead and cause a huge mess.

Why did you beat up a guy like that to a pulp?

659
00:41:46.273 --> 00:41:48.473
Whether he save a thousand lives...

660
00:41:48.543 --> 00:41:49.942
or 10,000 lives,

661
00:41:51.143 --> 00:41:52.773
that is none of my business.

662

It is also none my business.

Well...

665

Did you go home okay last night?

666
00:42:25.672 --> 00:42:26.982
Why do you carry a phone...

667
00:42:26.982 --> 00:42:28.313
when you don't even answer it?

668
00:42:28.342 --> 00:42:29.683
Did you call?

669
00:42:30.253 --> 00:42:31.382
I didn't know.

670
00:42:31.552 --> 00:42:32.552
Why did you call?

00:42:34.253 --> 00:42:35.322
Dr. Park...

672
00:42:37.322 --> 00:42:38.853
No. Never mind.

673
00:42:38.853 --> 00:42:40.692
What about Dr. Park?

674
00:42:40.862 --> 00:42:42.563
Keep talking.

675
00:42:42.893 --> 00:42:44.862
I called you because something happened.

676
00:42:47.262 --> 00:42:49.003
I shouldn't have had my hopes up.

677
00:42:49.632 --> 00:42:51.132
What do you mean?

678
00:42:53.743 --> 00:42:56.473
You were never there when I needed you.

679
00:43:03.482 --> 00:43:06.652
Gosh, Michael Jackson is awesome. The concert was amazing.

I know! When will he come back next time?

681
00:43:10.023 --> 00:43:11.092
Will he be back next year?

682
00:43:24.373 --> 00:43:25.433
Is it locked?

683
00:43:25.433 --> 00:43:27.373
Yes, it is.

684
00:43:30.543 --> 00:43:31.712
What do we do?

685
00:44:08.442 --> 00:44:10.512
Isn't it uncomfortable to sleep on the floor?

686
00:44:10.512 --> 00:44:11.753
No, I like sleeping on the floor.

687
00:44:11.753 --> 00:44:12.853
This is what I like.

688
00:44:19.223 --> 00:44:20.293
You don't say.

689
00:44:20.293 --> 00:44:22.523
You still haven't? But you have a boyfriend.

690
00:44:22.692 --> 00:44:24.862
I see you're against premarital sex,

691
00:44:24.862 --> 00:44:27.032
that's so old-fashioned.

692
00:44:43.382 --> 00:44:44.512
What?

693
00:44:44.512 --> 00:44:45.882
He's not interested at all.

694
00:44:58.663 --> 00:45:03.163
Until the day When the East Sea's waters

695
00:45:03.163 --> 00:45:06.473
And Mt. Baekdu are dry And worn away

696
00:45:07.043 --> 00:45:10.942
God protect and preserve us

697
00:45:11.112 --> 00:45:13.442
Long live our nation

698
00:45:28.092 --> 00:45:29.223
What?

699
00:45:29.462 --> 00:45:31.232
I need to go buy something.

700
00:45:32.092 --> 00:45:33.092
What?

701
00:45:36.262 --> 00:45:39.402
Where is he going at this time of the night?

702
00:45:40.743 --> 00:45:42.003
Goodness.

703
00:45:53.822 --> 00:45:54.853
What?

704
00:45:55.482 --> 00:45:56.482
No way.

705
00:45:58.893 --> 00:45:59.893
What am I going to do?

706
00:46:02.293 --> 00:46:03.322
That's cold.

707
00:46:06.962 --> 00:46:07.962
What?

708
00:46:25.183 --> 00:46:26.853
Did I wake you up?

709
00:46:27.453 --> 00:46:28.482
I'm sorry.

710
00:46:29.652 --> 00:46:31.253
I'm all for cheerleading,

711
00:46:31.253 --> 00:46:33.123
except for getting scrapes.

712
00:46:40.433 --> 00:46:41.703
You're so good.

713
00:47:18.333 --> 00:47:21.743
(Happy Karaoke, Mom's voice)

714
00:47:30.882 --> 00:47:32.953
(Dear Mom)

715
00:47:55.103 --> 00:47:56.873
(Grapes)

716
00:47:58.012 --> 00:47:59.012
What is this?

717
00:47:59.643 --> 00:48:00.743
Grapes.

718
00:48:01.413 --> 00:48:02.512
I know that.

719
00:48:07.623 --> 00:48:08.623
Why...

720
00:48:09.382 --> 00:48:10.753
am I like this?

721
00:48:14.692 --> 00:48:16.092
Why can't I...

722
00:48:19.163 --> 00:48:21.302
do anything right?

723
00:48:23.103 --> 00:48:24.302
I've always been...

724
00:48:26.103 --> 00:48:28.743
sincere.

725
00:48:30.572 --> 00:48:32.572
I always tried my best.

726
00:48:35.882 --> 00:48:37.683
But like 10 years ago today,

727
00:48:38.183 --> 00:48:40.152
everything is a mess.

728
00:48:46.822 --> 00:48:47.822
Over here!

729
00:48:51.793 --> 00:48:53.503
- Go home. - Yes, sir.

730
00:48:53.503 --> 00:48:55.503
- Good night, sir. - Hey, Manager Choi.

731
00:48:55.503 --> 00:48:57.072
Come to my hospital...

732
00:48:57.072 --> 00:48:59.072
with your drugs.

733
00:48:59.072 --> 00:49:00.103
Do you mean it, sir?

734
00:49:00.543 --> 00:49:02.973
- I'll be going now. - Thank you, sir!

735
00:49:06.212 --> 00:49:07.212
Good bye, sir.

736
00:49:11.012 --> 00:49:12.152
Yes.

737
00:49:13.353 --> 00:49:16.893
Hey! Hey! Hey!

738
00:49:17.422 --> 00:49:19.692
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

739
00:49:20.223 --> 00:49:21.293
What are you doing?

740
00:49:21.663 --> 00:49:22.793
Get up.

741
00:49:22.893 --> 00:49:24.393
- Gosh. - These scums.

742
00:49:26.862 --> 00:49:28.762
- Stand up. - Give me a cigarette.

743
00:49:28.962 --> 00:49:30.003
Hey!

744
00:49:30.933 --> 00:49:31.933
Scums.

745
00:49:32.732 --> 00:49:35.003
Hey, the one on the ground, come here.

746
00:49:35.643 --> 00:49:37.442
- Hey, what are you doing? - It's fine. Come here.

747
00:49:37.543 --> 00:49:39.112
- Come here. - Gosh.

748
00:49:39.112 --> 00:49:41.442
- He should just leave quietly. - What's he doing?

749
00:49:41.612 --> 00:49:42.942
- Gosh. - Are you all right?

750
00:49:43.612 --> 00:49:45.212
You should go home.

751
00:49:46.382 --> 00:49:47.382
Look at him.

752
00:49:47.723 --> 00:49:49.083
Scums.

753
00:49:49.083 --> 00:49:51.253
Where did you learn to bully your friends like that?

754
00:49:51.822 --> 00:49:53.862
I don't care whether you drink or smoke...

755
00:49:53.862 --> 00:49:56.293
because it's your body.

756
00:49:57.262 --> 00:49:58.592
But don't bully your friends.

757
00:49:59.663 --> 00:50:00.732
What's he saying?

758
00:50:01.762 --> 00:50:04.132
- He should have just left. - Gosh.

759
00:50:04.203 --> 00:50:05.632
- Just go. - Gosh.

760
00:50:06.632 --> 00:50:07.743
Yes?

761
00:50:09.243 --> 00:50:10.313
Choi Ban Do.

762
00:50:10.712 --> 00:50:11.973
Please come quickly.

763
00:50:13.683 --> 00:50:15.612
Ban Do, come quickly.

764
00:50:17.313 --> 00:50:18.782
I'm going.

765
00:50:19.782 --> 00:50:20.922
Hey, old man.

766
00:50:21.123 --> 00:50:22.683
You need to have a word with me.

767
00:50:25.152 --> 00:50:26.393
- Gosh. - Stop.

768
00:50:26.393 --> 00:50:27.793
- Hello? - You scum.

769
00:50:27.922 --> 00:50:29.023
- Gosh. - Shut it.

770
00:50:29.762 --> 00:50:30.793
Hello?

771
00:50:31.063 --> 00:50:32.692
- Stop it. - What's wrong?

772
00:50:33.703 --> 00:50:35.032
What's wrong, honey?

773
00:50:36.132 --> 00:50:37.402
What's wrong? What's happening?

774
00:50:38.103 --> 00:50:39.632
What should I do? What should I do?

775
00:50:40.203 --> 00:50:41.273
Mom.

776
00:50:42.373 --> 00:50:43.442
What should I do?

777
00:50:43.643 --> 00:50:46.543
Wait a moment. Wait a moment. I just need to speak to him.

778
00:50:46.913 --> 00:50:48.512
I really need to go right now.

779
00:50:49.212 --> 00:50:50.652
You hit them too. You can't.

780
00:50:50.652 --> 00:50:53.083
Detective, I really need to go. Please.

781
00:50:53.083 --> 00:50:54.322
Gosh.

782
00:50:54.322 --> 00:50:55.422
- What are you doing? - Pull him away.

783
00:50:55.422 --> 00:50:57.353
- I really need to go now. - Gosh.

784
00:50:57.393 --> 00:50:59.023
I have somewhere else to be.

785
00:50:59.192 --> 00:51:01.893
Please, Detective. Please, I need to go.

786
00:51:02.663 --> 00:51:03.962
Let me go. Let me go!

787
00:51:04.132 --> 00:51:05.232
Let me go!

788
00:51:18.842 --> 00:51:20.313
Why do you do this all the time?

789
00:51:23.552 --> 00:51:25.282
Why did you do this?

790
00:51:35.322 --> 00:51:37.592
Why did you have to do this?

791
00:51:47.572 --> 00:51:48.572
Because of you...

792
00:51:50.072 --> 00:51:51.512
Because of you...

793
00:51:53.112 --> 00:51:55.212
she died before she had a chance to look at me one last time.

794
00:52:16.773 --> 00:52:18.373
I'm sorry.

795
00:52:19.773 --> 00:52:22.103
I'm sorry, Mother-in-law.

796
00:52:23.273 --> 00:52:24.543
I'm sorry.

797
00:52:25.873 --> 00:52:27.282
I'm so sorry.

798
00:52:43.793 --> 00:52:44.893
I'm sorry.

799
00:52:45.732 --> 00:52:46.933
I'm sorry.

800
00:52:55.342 --> 00:52:56.643
I've tried so hard...

801
00:52:58.712 --> 00:53:02.183
so that I could lead a happy life.

802
00:53:04.512 --> 00:53:06.282
Why do I always have to be sorry?

803
00:53:07.223 --> 00:53:08.552
Why am I always apologizing?

804
00:53:12.893 --> 00:53:14.163
I missed my mother-in-law...

805
00:53:16.262 --> 00:53:18.692
just as much as you did.

806
00:53:22.302 --> 00:53:25.473
I missed my mother-in-law just as much as you did.

807
00:53:47.592 --> 00:53:48.962
What's this about?

808
00:53:50.462 --> 00:53:51.632
Mom.

809
00:54:15.282 --> 00:54:20.063
The King of Pop, Michael Jackson, died today at his house.

810
00:54:20.592 --> 00:54:24.032
On June 25, 1999, 10 years ago today,

811
00:54:24.163 --> 00:54:26.163
he had a concert here in Korea.

812
00:54:26.163 --> 00:54:29.603
A lot of Korean fans are concerned about his death.

813
00:54:29.663 --> 00:54:31.402
- This doesn't make sense. - Gosh.

814
00:54:31.402 --> 00:54:32.433
(Michael Jackson's Sudden Death Shocks People. Why?)

815
00:54:32.433 --> 00:54:35.243
The day my mom, who was like the universe to me, disappeared,

816
00:54:36.172 --> 00:54:40.913
the rest of the world was paying attention to something else.

817
00:54:43.083 --> 00:54:45.953
And my sorrow seemed to be ignored just like that,

818
00:54:45.953 --> 00:54:47.953
as something petty and normal,

819
00:54:49.523 --> 00:54:51.922
even to the closest person.

820
00:54:52.453 --> 00:54:57.732
(Three months after Eun Sook's funeral)

821
00:55:38.003 --> 00:55:39.103
I'm home.

822
00:55:40.103 --> 00:55:41.243
Guess what I bought for you.

823
00:55:42.143 --> 00:55:43.172
Ta-da!

824
00:55:43.172 --> 00:55:44.842
I bought pork slices that you like.

825
00:55:45.442 --> 00:55:46.572
Don't you like it?

826
00:55:47.112 --> 00:55:48.382
Stay right there.

827
00:55:48.382 --> 00:55:50.482
I'll change my clothes and prepare them for you.

828
00:55:51.012 --> 00:55:52.512
All right? Stay right there.
