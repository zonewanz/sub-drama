00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.349
(Episode 12)

2
00:00:24.565 --> 00:00:27.205
Around midnight, a stabbing occurred...

3
00:00:27.205 --> 00:00:29.174
in a bar in Yeongpa.

4
00:00:30.505 --> 00:00:32.075
The police believe a male patron...

5
00:00:32.075 --> 00:00:33.675
murdered Geum, the owner of the bar,

6
00:00:33.675 --> 00:00:35.145
and fled the scene.

7
00:00:35.314 --> 00:00:37.745
They stated that they'd focus the investigation...

8
00:00:37.745 --> 00:00:40.685
on patrons caught on the bar's security video.

9
00:00:42.454 --> 00:00:45.124
You said he was stabbed around midnight.

10
00:00:45.124 --> 00:00:46.624
I left the bar...

11
00:00:46.624 --> 00:00:48.255
at 10:30pm.

12
00:00:48.395 --> 00:00:49.454
Just a minute.

13
00:00:54.194 --> 00:00:55.194
Excuse me.

14
00:00:56.194 --> 00:00:57.264
Will it be much longer?

15
00:00:57.664 --> 00:00:59.234
Wait a minute.

16
00:01:05.605 --> 00:01:06.874
Okay, you're good.

17
00:01:08.745 --> 00:01:09.745
Pardon?

18
00:01:09.945 --> 00:01:11.484
I've confirmed your alibi,

19
00:01:11.484 --> 00:01:12.685
so you may go.

20
00:01:16.585 --> 00:01:18.454
(Yeongpa City Council)

21
00:01:18.454 --> 00:01:19.454
I'm back.

22
00:01:20.185 --> 00:01:21.295
So?

23
00:01:22.094 --> 00:01:24.325
What did the doctor say?

24
00:01:24.495 --> 00:01:26.764
He says your wife suffered a small shock.

25
00:01:28.135 --> 00:01:29.195
I told him...

26
00:01:29.195 --> 00:01:30.935
to make sure she does not wake up.

27
00:01:33.435 --> 00:01:35.435
He can't keep her asleep?

28
00:01:35.674 --> 00:01:37.405
With all the money I give him?

29
00:01:42.844 --> 00:01:43.844
Excuse me.

30
00:01:48.754 --> 00:01:51.055
- Hello? - This is the police.

31
00:01:51.055 --> 00:01:53.454
Is this Kim Hyung Soo, who was questioned...

32
00:01:53.454 --> 00:01:54.724
regarding the bar murder?

33
00:01:55.055 --> 00:01:56.055
Yes, I am.

34
00:01:56.055 --> 00:01:57.424
Your DNA...

35
00:01:57.424 --> 00:01:59.995
matches the assailant of the 1997...

36
00:01:59.995 --> 00:02:01.594
Yiwang sexual assault case.

37
00:02:01.594 --> 00:02:02.594
What?

38
00:02:21.715 --> 00:02:22.854
Hello?

39
00:02:23.015 --> 00:02:24.115
Ms. Hong Sun Hwa?

40
00:02:24.724 --> 00:02:26.324
This is the Gangnam Police Department.

41
00:02:27.455 --> 00:02:28.925
You reported being sexually assaulted...

42
00:02:28.925 --> 00:02:31.194
in Yiwang 20 years ago, correct?

43
00:02:34.224 --> 00:02:35.335
Yes.

44
00:02:35.495 --> 00:02:36.965
We found the assailant.

45
00:02:38.465 --> 00:02:40.365
Would you like to press charges?

46
00:02:43.004 --> 00:02:44.074
Yes.

47
00:03:01.455 --> 00:03:06.294
(Witch's Court)

48
00:03:28.715 --> 00:03:32.784
(November, 1997)

49
00:03:32.784 --> 00:03:33.854
What?

50
00:03:52.004 --> 00:03:54.145
Let's go. I'll take you home.

51
00:04:01.884 --> 00:04:03.455
(Emergency Room)

52
00:04:12.724 --> 00:04:14.395
One month shy of its statute of limitations,

53
00:04:14.395 --> 00:04:16.335
the assailant was identified...

54
00:04:16.335 --> 00:04:18.065
for this sexual assault case.

55
00:04:18.664 --> 00:04:20.265
The assailant is Kim Hyung Soo.

56
00:04:20.265 --> 00:04:23.005
He is a spokesperson for Yeongpa's mayor.

57
00:04:23.104 --> 00:04:26.344
In 1997, he was a senior in high school.

58
00:04:26.344 --> 00:04:29.174
1997? That was exactly 20 years ago.

59
00:04:29.174 --> 00:04:30.815
The victim is Hong Sun Hwa.

60
00:04:30.815 --> 00:04:32.145
She is a janitor...

61
00:04:32.145 --> 00:04:33.984
at Hanguk University.

62
00:04:33.984 --> 00:04:37.315
At the time, she was also a senior in high school.

63
00:04:37.484 --> 00:04:40.325
They left good evidence for that time.

64
00:04:40.325 --> 00:04:42.255
They got her statement right away,

65
00:04:42.255 --> 00:04:43.794
and the DNA.

66
00:04:43.794 --> 00:04:44.864
I know.

67
00:04:44.864 --> 00:04:46.325
Why couldn't they catch him then?

68
00:04:46.325 --> 00:04:47.395
Why did it go unsolved?

69
00:04:47.395 --> 00:04:49.364
They met while traveling...

70
00:04:49.364 --> 00:04:51.505
after taking the college entrance exam,

71
00:04:51.505 --> 00:04:54.104
so he gave her a fake name and school information.

72
00:04:54.104 --> 00:04:56.174
True. Who wants to give their real name...

73
00:04:56.174 --> 00:04:57.775
when they meet someone at a club?

74
00:05:00.705 --> 00:05:03.244
It's such a relief that we caught him now,

75
00:05:03.244 --> 00:05:05.244
don't you agree everyone?

76
00:05:05.244 --> 00:05:08.614
But 20 years is such a long time.

77
00:05:08.614 --> 00:05:09.984
Would they remember?

78
00:05:09.984 --> 00:05:12.424
I know. I was also a senior back then.

79
00:05:12.424 --> 00:05:14.895
I could barely remember my friends' names.

80
00:05:14.895 --> 00:05:17.294
People's memories cannot be perfect.

81
00:05:17.294 --> 00:05:19.325
They get exaggerated at times,

82
00:05:19.325 --> 00:05:21.195
and sometimes erased when inconvenient.

83
00:05:21.195 --> 00:05:23.835
What if they won't accept her statement as evidence?

84
00:05:23.835 --> 00:05:26.304
The victim wants to press charges,

85
00:05:26.304 --> 00:05:27.604
so we must do our best.

86
00:05:27.804 --> 00:05:29.875
Yes. They say there is no statute of limitations...

87
00:05:29.875 --> 00:05:32.005
when it comes to the victim's pain.

88
00:05:32.544 --> 00:05:33.544
Old crimes...

89
00:05:33.544 --> 00:05:36.044
tend to go unpunished.

90
00:05:36.315 --> 00:05:38.984
But let's change that this time.

91
00:05:38.984 --> 00:05:39.984
Yes, ma'am.

92
00:05:41.585 --> 00:05:43.184
You know...

93
00:05:43.184 --> 00:05:45.025
that Cho Gap Soo's spokesman, Kim Hyung Soo,

94
00:05:45.025 --> 00:05:46.625
was arrested for sexual assault.

95
00:05:47.284 --> 00:05:49.325
They have solid DNA evidence too.

96
00:05:49.325 --> 00:05:50.924
If we're forceful from the start,

97
00:05:50.924 --> 00:05:52.825
he'll spill everything...

98
00:05:52.924 --> 00:05:55.465
about Cho Gap Soo's weakness.

99
00:05:55.965 --> 00:05:56.994
So?

100
00:05:57.294 --> 00:05:58.835
I need your help.

101
00:05:59.205 --> 00:06:01.974
I know you didn't give up on Cho Gap Soo.

102
00:06:02.304 --> 00:06:04.234
Please let me fight with you.

103
00:06:06.344 --> 00:06:07.945
I want to work here.

104
00:06:09.674 --> 00:06:10.815
I don't want to.

105
00:06:12.145 --> 00:06:13.184
Pardon?

106
00:06:13.414 --> 00:06:15.015
Don't you remember Kong Soo Ah's case?

107
00:06:15.914 --> 00:06:18.155
What did you say to me back then?

108
00:06:18.155 --> 00:06:19.385
You said you'd catch...

109
00:06:19.385 --> 00:06:21.354
Cho Gap Soo and close Kong Soo Ah's case.

110
00:06:21.354 --> 00:06:22.554
But how did that go?

111
00:06:23.625 --> 00:06:24.895
I'm repenting.

112
00:06:25.424 --> 00:06:26.465
You're repenting,

113
00:06:26.465 --> 00:06:29.395
but you'll do what to Kim Hyung Soo?

114
00:06:32.304 --> 00:06:34.875
You lost a case because of your personal interests.

115
00:06:34.875 --> 00:06:36.534
Once is more than enough.

116
00:06:36.934 --> 00:06:39.705
You seem to be confused, so I'll set you straight.

117
00:06:39.705 --> 00:06:42.645
You're not a prosecutor anymore.

118
00:06:42.914 --> 00:06:44.174
You're a lawyer.

119
00:06:44.174 --> 00:06:46.184
This is a lawyers' office.

120
00:06:46.184 --> 00:06:48.854
If you want to prosecute, be a prosecutor.

121
00:06:49.255 --> 00:06:51.424
If you really can't let go,

122
00:06:51.424 --> 00:06:54.155
you can try applying for prosecutor positions.

123
00:06:54.155 --> 00:06:55.255
There must be some available.

124
00:06:55.255 --> 00:06:56.755
A prosecutor? No way.

125
00:06:56.755 --> 00:06:59.025
My goal is to defend victims.

126
00:06:59.625 --> 00:07:02.164
- What? - You don't believe me.

127
00:07:02.164 --> 00:07:04.405
I understand, but I've changed.

128
00:07:04.405 --> 00:07:06.205
I'm not the same Ma Yi Deum.

129
00:07:06.565 --> 00:07:08.205
How could I not change...

130
00:07:08.205 --> 00:07:10.304
after getting you fired too?

131
00:07:11.744 --> 00:07:14.174
I won't do anything unethical anymore.

132
00:07:14.174 --> 00:07:16.375
I'll become a warm lawyer who wipes victims' tears,

133
00:07:16.375 --> 00:07:17.375
fights against perpetrators,

134
00:07:17.375 --> 00:07:20.385
a lawyer that is honest and just.

135
00:07:26.054 --> 00:07:27.085
Really?

136
00:07:28.155 --> 00:07:29.724
Okay. I see.

137
00:07:29.994 --> 00:07:31.224
In that case,

138
00:07:31.765 --> 00:07:32.765
give it a shot.

139
00:07:34.465 --> 00:07:35.465
Really?

140
00:07:37.135 --> 00:07:38.135
Thank you.

141
00:07:42.804 --> 00:07:44.405
(Prosecutor: Yeo Jin Wook)

142
00:07:52.945 --> 00:07:54.145
Ma will be going...

143
00:07:54.145 --> 00:07:57.114
as a cooperating attorney on Kim Hyung Soo's case.

144
00:07:57.315 --> 00:07:59.825
Keep an eye on her to make sure she behaves.

145
00:08:06.965 --> 00:08:08.994
- Amazing. Really? - Yes.

146
00:08:09.265 --> 00:08:10.734
What about this?

147
00:08:10.734 --> 00:08:12.034
No, not that.

148
00:08:12.034 --> 00:08:13.364
- No? - Of course, not.

149
00:08:14.005 --> 00:08:15.005
Hi.

150
00:08:15.434 --> 00:08:16.434
You're here.

151
00:08:17.304 --> 00:08:18.474
What are you doing here?

152
00:08:18.844 --> 00:08:22.044
Ma brought a strategy for the Kim Hyung Soo case.

153
00:08:22.445 --> 00:08:23.544
It's awesome.

154
00:08:23.544 --> 00:08:24.984
She really is our ace.

155
00:08:25.215 --> 00:08:26.515
You're too kind.

156
00:08:26.844 --> 00:08:28.614
Why is she coming up with the strategy?

157
00:08:28.815 --> 00:08:30.815
And why are you listening to her?

158
00:08:30.815 --> 00:08:33.824
Don't be so stiff. We should help each other.

159
00:08:34.084 --> 00:08:36.395
Right? You are wise.

160
00:08:36.525 --> 00:08:39.025
So? How far do you plan to take it?

161
00:08:39.464 --> 00:08:41.564
I don't know how far yet.

162
00:08:41.564 --> 00:08:44.635
First, I think we need a new prosecutor.

163
00:08:45.164 --> 00:08:47.674
I mean, Park is such an ace.

164
00:08:47.674 --> 00:08:51.204
And I'll support him with all that I have.

165
00:08:51.204 --> 00:08:53.375
We'll clean house. You'll be shocked.

166
00:08:53.375 --> 00:08:55.145
- I... - Out.

167
00:08:55.245 --> 00:08:58.044
I said I'd walk out on my own.

168
00:09:00.954 --> 00:09:02.115
- I'll call you. - Call? No.

169
00:09:11.765 --> 00:09:13.064
Sit down. Here.

170
00:09:25.505 --> 00:09:26.875
We'll start the interrogation.

171
00:09:28.745 --> 00:09:31.145
You denied to your charges at the station?

172
00:09:32.084 --> 00:09:33.115
I did.

173
00:09:33.314 --> 00:09:35.615
I have no memory of raping her.

174
00:09:35.985 --> 00:09:37.625
Are you saying you don't remember?

175
00:09:37.954 --> 00:09:40.355
No, I remember exactly.

176
00:09:41.554 --> 00:09:43.924
It was November 22, a Saturday.

177
00:09:44.365 --> 00:09:46.265
We met near the river in Yiwang.

178
00:09:46.995 --> 00:09:49.464
I even remember making a campfire at 9pm.

179
00:09:50.735 --> 00:09:52.735
It's a lot different from what Hong Sun Hwa said.

180
00:09:53.434 --> 00:09:55.034
- Are you sure? - Yes.

181
00:09:55.174 --> 00:09:56.275
At that time,

182
00:09:57.704 --> 00:09:59.544
I fell in love with her at first sight.

183
00:10:01.245 --> 00:10:03.145
My heart was racing when we held hands.

184
00:10:03.914 --> 00:10:06.814
I even remember her smile when I kissed her cheek.

185
00:10:07.714 --> 00:10:09.985
I remember it because it was beautiful.

186
00:10:13.625 --> 00:10:15.725
"Cuts and bleeding in a specific place."

187
00:10:15.725 --> 00:10:17.694
"Panic from psychological trauma."

188
00:10:17.924 --> 00:10:19.824
"DNA found from the semen."

189
00:10:23.694 --> 00:10:25.735
This is the victim's medical report.

190
00:10:25.735 --> 00:10:26.964
(Hong Sun Hwa)

191
00:10:27.064 --> 00:10:29.034
It seems like it's far from being beautiful.

192
00:10:31.345 --> 00:10:32.905
What happened 20 years ago...

193
00:10:33.475 --> 00:10:36.275
must be a sweet summer memory to you.

194
00:10:37.645 --> 00:10:39.814
You better revisit your memory,

195
00:10:40.444 --> 00:10:41.554
Kim Hyung Soo.

196
00:10:46.855 --> 00:10:48.924
- Good job. - Thank you.

197
00:10:53.525 --> 00:10:54.635
Ma?

198
00:10:57.095 --> 00:10:59.304
- Gosh. - What are you doing?

199
00:11:00.235 --> 00:11:01.674
I found something on the floor.

200
00:11:02.074 --> 00:11:03.334
It's hot.

201
00:11:04.605 --> 00:11:05.745
Have you been well?

202
00:11:11.345 --> 00:11:12.414
What?

203
00:11:12.515 --> 00:11:15.684
As the attorney, I must defend...

204
00:11:15.684 --> 00:11:17.314
You're such a liar.

205
00:11:17.485 --> 00:11:19.355
I know you.

206
00:11:19.725 --> 00:11:23.095
I know you got on the case to catch Cho Gap Soo.

207
00:11:23.625 --> 00:11:27.095
I'm glad you know. Let's work well together.

208
00:11:27.395 --> 00:11:29.895
- Ms. Ma. - I got it.

209
00:11:30.765 --> 00:11:32.464
I didn't forget about Kong Soo Ah's case.

210
00:11:32.865 --> 00:11:34.875
I promised not to ruin the case...

211
00:11:34.875 --> 00:11:36.275
for personal reasons.

212
00:11:37.434 --> 00:11:40.405
- Happy? - I'll trust you.

213
00:11:40.975 --> 00:11:44.345
But we must split up the work.

214
00:11:44.944 --> 00:11:46.684
- Split up? - You said so yourself.

215
00:11:46.845 --> 00:11:50.255
I'm a prosecutor, and you're a lawyer.

216
00:11:50.985 --> 00:11:52.755
I'll say the same to you.

217
00:11:53.454 --> 00:11:56.125
From now on, you're a lawyer.

218
00:11:56.255 --> 00:11:59.095
You must follow my orders, requests,

219
00:11:59.595 --> 00:12:00.964
and commands.

220
00:12:01.395 --> 00:12:04.464
But... I'm not an assistant prosecutor.

221
00:12:04.464 --> 00:12:06.005
You can quit if you don't want to.

222
00:12:07.365 --> 00:12:09.574
I'll give you 5 seconds. 5, 3, 2.

223
00:12:09.635 --> 00:12:10.944
Fine, fine.

224
00:12:11.975 --> 00:12:14.105
- Go wait at the office. - Why?

225
00:12:16.145 --> 00:12:18.944
- Are you staying here? - Cross-examination.

226
00:12:19.184 --> 00:12:21.615
They won't agree if we interrogate separately.

227
00:12:21.914 --> 00:12:23.615
If we go to court in this state,

228
00:12:23.615 --> 00:12:25.985
there's no credibility since it's so long ago.

229
00:12:25.985 --> 00:12:29.324
The victim must request for it in order to happen.

230
00:12:29.355 --> 00:12:32.225
Then you're saying I must make her request it first.

231
00:12:33.424 --> 00:12:34.564
Car keys.

232
00:12:38.534 --> 00:12:39.704
Seriously.

233
00:12:40.464 --> 00:12:41.605
Thank you.

234
00:12:48.615 --> 00:12:49.775
I don't want to.

235
00:12:50.714 --> 00:12:52.015
I already told the police...

236
00:12:52.044 --> 00:12:55.084
20 years ago about what happened.

237
00:12:56.015 --> 00:12:57.515
I have nothing more to say.

238
00:12:57.855 --> 00:13:00.454
- Sun Hwa. - No cross-examination.

239
00:13:01.025 --> 00:13:03.554
- Please leave. - The washroom is nasty.

240
00:13:04.765 --> 00:13:06.725
Ms. Hong!

241
00:13:10.495 --> 00:13:12.564
Why are you wasting your time?

242
00:13:13.505 --> 00:13:16.834
Clean the men's washroom and the classroom.

243
00:13:17.034 --> 00:13:18.345
Yes, sir.

244
00:13:23.314 --> 00:13:24.444
Not again.

245
00:13:25.044 --> 00:13:28.485
What's the big deal about going in here?

246
00:13:28.914 --> 00:13:30.954
Other ladies can walk in no problem...

247
00:13:30.954 --> 00:13:33.885
and clean it even with men inside.

248
00:13:34.454 --> 00:13:35.755
I'm sorry.

249
00:13:36.525 --> 00:13:39.225
I'll do it. So please reconsider it.

250
00:13:40.095 --> 00:13:41.595
I'll clean it.

251
00:13:41.934 --> 00:13:43.135
Here we go.

252
00:13:50.135 --> 00:13:51.204
Hi.

253
00:13:53.775 --> 00:13:56.044
It's super clean. I did a good job.

254
00:13:59.515 --> 00:14:00.584
Where did she go?

255
00:14:04.255 --> 00:14:07.125
Hong Sun Hwa? Where is she?

256
00:14:08.554 --> 00:14:10.125
Hong Sun Hwa?

257
00:14:15.895 --> 00:14:17.464
Please don't be like this.

258
00:14:20.934 --> 00:14:22.875
I'm helping you.

259
00:14:23.204 --> 00:14:25.645
This is how you should wipe.

260
00:14:25.745 --> 00:14:28.015
Like this. Like this.

261
00:14:28.145 --> 00:14:30.845
- Like this. Go like this. - I got it.

262
00:14:31.184 --> 00:14:33.115
Please don't do this.

263
00:14:37.084 --> 00:14:40.385
You're more curvy than I thought.

264
00:14:43.025 --> 00:14:45.225
Keep wiping.

265
00:14:48.034 --> 00:14:49.464
Is he crazy?

266
00:14:55.674 --> 00:14:57.845
This is too disgusting to look.

267
00:14:57.845 --> 00:14:59.704
Did someone poop?

268
00:14:59.975 --> 00:15:02.444
Did a group of pigeons come here?

269
00:15:10.684 --> 00:15:11.855
Sun Hwa?

270
00:15:12.284 --> 00:15:15.625
How does she disappear every time I blink?

271
00:15:17.995 --> 00:15:19.025
How tiring.

272
00:15:21.194 --> 00:15:24.505
(MOU Signing for Yeongpa...)

273
00:15:24.505 --> 00:15:27.834
(and Hankuk University's Mutual Development)

274
00:15:49.954 --> 00:15:51.794
You didn't forget about...

275
00:15:51.794 --> 00:15:53.595
the meeting with the prime minister, right?

276
00:15:53.924 --> 00:15:55.095
Of course not.

277
00:15:56.095 --> 00:15:57.495
What is it about anyway?

278
00:15:59.164 --> 00:16:02.975
I think he's looking into his grandson's school.

279
00:16:04.074 --> 00:16:06.905
He was interested in your law school.

280
00:16:10.544 --> 00:16:14.015
The same law school that he attended?

281
00:16:15.554 --> 00:16:17.084
That would be meaningful.

282
00:16:18.255 --> 00:16:20.424
Yes. I'll see you in a bit.

283
00:16:20.424 --> 00:16:21.895
- Okay. - Bye.

284
00:16:28.635 --> 00:16:31.605
Hong Sun Hwa. Hong Sun Hwa.

285
00:17:15.014 --> 00:17:16.115
Did you get scared?

286
00:17:18.184 --> 00:17:20.045
It's too early for you to back out.

287
00:17:20.385 --> 00:17:21.785
It's only a start.

288
00:17:24.454 --> 00:17:27.224
Where did Hong Sun Hwa go? Hong Sun Hwa?

289
00:17:27.694 --> 00:17:29.125
Hong Sun Hwa?

290
00:17:30.494 --> 00:17:33.764
Hong Sun Hwa? Where are you?

291
00:17:35.964 --> 00:17:39.565
What kind of crazy woman is that?

292
00:17:44.575 --> 00:17:46.674
Looking at her eyes, I think...

293
00:17:46.674 --> 00:17:49.075
she's thinking about how to attack me.

294
00:17:50.375 --> 00:17:54.085
Look into what she's scheming.

295
00:17:56.315 --> 00:17:58.125
Yes, sir.

296
00:18:00.994 --> 00:18:03.395
Gosh. Where is she?

297
00:18:04.664 --> 00:18:05.795
This is driving me crazy.

298
00:18:08.635 --> 00:18:11.234
Chan, did you walk all the way here again?

299
00:18:12.365 --> 00:18:14.405
I told you not to do that.

300
00:18:14.835 --> 00:18:16.674
I told you I'll protect you.

301
00:18:16.934 --> 00:18:20.575
You jump whenever a man passes by you.

302
00:18:21.145 --> 00:18:22.875
Why do you keep on telling me not to come?

303
00:18:23.514 --> 00:18:25.145
I told you, I'm fine.

304
00:18:25.184 --> 00:18:27.214
I know you're not fine.

305
00:18:28.184 --> 00:18:29.785
My legs hurt.

306
00:18:32.355 --> 00:18:33.454
Here.

307
00:18:37.224 --> 00:18:40.264
I know you always come for the piggyback.

308
00:18:40.625 --> 00:18:41.734
That's not true.

309
00:18:55.645 --> 00:18:57.014
Hey, Yi Deum.

310
00:18:58.115 --> 00:19:00.145
It won't kill you to be in second.

311
00:19:00.315 --> 00:19:01.855
Who said you should run...

312
00:19:01.855 --> 00:19:03.914
while pushing all your friends?

313
00:19:03.914 --> 00:19:06.555
You fell because you were being mean.

314
00:19:07.024 --> 00:19:08.125
Mom,

315
00:19:08.655 --> 00:19:11.024
do you want to make fun of your injured daughter?

316
00:19:12.164 --> 00:19:14.264
If you ran slower and carefully,

317
00:19:14.264 --> 00:19:16.535
no one would have gotten hurt.

318
00:19:17.135 --> 00:19:18.635
If you run slow,

319
00:19:18.635 --> 00:19:20.605
how is that a race?

320
00:19:21.905 --> 00:19:23.934
Forget it. I'm hungry.

321
00:19:24.174 --> 00:19:25.444
Let's hurry home and eat.

322
00:19:27.444 --> 00:19:29.345
There's only gimbap at home.

323
00:19:29.714 --> 00:19:32.484
You said you wanted to eat gimbap,

324
00:19:32.785 --> 00:19:34.414
so I got enough for you...

325
00:19:34.414 --> 00:19:35.785
to eat for three days.

326
00:19:36.055 --> 00:19:37.724
Mom!

327
00:19:37.724 --> 00:19:39.055
Come on.

328
00:19:40.555 --> 00:19:42.454
Stay still. Don't move,

329
00:19:42.454 --> 00:19:44.155
you're heavy.

330
00:19:44.155 --> 00:19:45.625
- No. - Gosh.

331
00:19:45.625 --> 00:19:46.724
Let's hurry home.

332
00:20:17.224 --> 00:20:18.325
Hey!

333
00:20:18.964 --> 00:20:20.494
- Move! - What is going on?

334
00:20:20.494 --> 00:20:22.194
What are you doing?

335
00:20:22.395 --> 00:20:23.535
Get on.

336
00:20:23.964 --> 00:20:25.305
I'm going to keep crawling...

337
00:20:25.305 --> 00:20:26.704
until you get on.

338
00:20:26.704 --> 00:20:28.875
Hey! What are you doing?

339
00:20:28.875 --> 00:20:30.974
- Hurry up! - Please, stop it.

340
00:20:30.974 --> 00:20:31.974
Get on.

341
00:20:31.974 --> 00:20:33.474
- Hey! - What are you doing?

342
00:20:33.474 --> 00:20:35.875
Mom, it's too loud.

343
00:20:36.545 --> 00:20:39.145
- What are you doing? - Come on!

344
00:20:39.585 --> 00:20:41.254
Hurry up and go!

345
00:20:41.254 --> 00:20:43.855
- Move your car! - Get going!

346
00:20:43.855 --> 00:20:45.585
Hurry up!

347
00:20:55.994 --> 00:20:57.494
- Son. - Dad!

348
00:20:57.605 --> 00:20:59.305
Gosh.

349
00:21:01.734 --> 00:21:03.274
Are you here?

350
00:21:05.145 --> 00:21:06.645
Who is she?

351
00:21:06.645 --> 00:21:09.075
She's a lawyer helping Mom.

352
00:21:10.944 --> 00:21:11.944
Hello.

353
00:21:12.714 --> 00:21:15.315
Chan, I'll get going. You should go inside.

354
00:21:15.315 --> 00:21:17.655
Mom, I drew a picture at school.

355
00:21:17.655 --> 00:21:19.055
Look at it first before you go.

356
00:21:19.055 --> 00:21:20.454
Please?

357
00:21:28.234 --> 00:21:29.964
Ma'am,

358
00:21:30.535 --> 00:21:33.135
will you be working on her case?

359
00:21:33.305 --> 00:21:34.305
Yes.

360
00:21:36.835 --> 00:21:38.004
Please.

361
00:21:38.004 --> 00:21:40.944
Make sure that evil man gets punished.

362
00:21:41.214 --> 00:21:43.575
It looks like you don't live together.

363
00:21:43.714 --> 00:21:44.984
Isn't it out of your place...

364
00:21:45.585 --> 00:21:47.184
to ask me for a favor?

365
00:21:49.385 --> 00:21:50.984
I don't want anything else.

366
00:21:51.385 --> 00:21:52.424
I just want...

367
00:21:54.085 --> 00:21:55.095
her...

368
00:21:55.454 --> 00:21:57.325
to live a happy life.

369
00:21:58.224 --> 00:22:00.964
Although time passed,

370
00:22:01.565 --> 00:22:03.264
she still gets nightmares.

371
00:22:03.565 --> 00:22:04.835
She's still scared...

372
00:22:05.035 --> 00:22:06.664
of men.

373
00:22:08.004 --> 00:22:10.375
Chan and I wanted...

374
00:22:11.105 --> 00:22:12.905
to help her get over it.

375
00:22:17.944 --> 00:22:19.984
Please take good care of her.

376
00:22:20.684 --> 00:22:23.155
As much as she was hurt...

377
00:22:23.484 --> 00:22:24.484
No.

378
00:22:25.085 --> 00:22:26.724
I want that evil man...

379
00:22:28.795 --> 00:22:29.825
to suffer...

380
00:22:30.355 --> 00:22:32.625
in prison way longer than that.

381
00:22:38.105 --> 00:22:39.305
Ms. Ma,

382
00:22:40.934 --> 00:22:42.905
you've never been in my place, have you?

383
00:22:44.135 --> 00:22:45.244
It's...

384
00:22:46.405 --> 00:22:48.875
not something that's just difficult.

385
00:22:49.914 --> 00:22:52.645
You're telling me to relive the nightmare...

386
00:22:54.414 --> 00:22:57.254
along with the man that drove me there.

387
00:23:02.595 --> 00:23:03.895
Long time ago,

388
00:23:06.164 --> 00:23:08.964
there was a kind woman who ran...

389
00:23:09.664 --> 00:23:12.135
a noodle restaurant with her daughter.

390
00:23:13.504 --> 00:23:14.934
That woman...

391
00:23:16.234 --> 00:23:17.704
experienced something similar.

392
00:23:20.375 --> 00:23:22.474
It must have hurt a lot,

393
00:23:23.615 --> 00:23:26.014
but she never showed it.

394
00:23:28.514 --> 00:23:30.454
Then she was abducted...

395
00:23:30.684 --> 00:23:33.125
and confined by the same assailant.

396
00:23:35.625 --> 00:23:37.224
In the end, she died.

397
00:23:39.264 --> 00:23:40.895
Without leaving a trace.

398
00:23:43.934 --> 00:23:45.035
That jerk...

399
00:23:45.835 --> 00:23:47.835
is doing well.

400
00:23:48.434 --> 00:23:49.575
Do you know why?

401
00:23:51.645 --> 00:23:54.105
There's no evidence to show that he did it.

402
00:23:55.315 --> 00:23:57.014
Also, a victim who could testify...

403
00:23:58.244 --> 00:23:59.714
is no longer alive.

404
00:24:01.754 --> 00:24:03.285
But you can...

405
00:24:03.414 --> 00:24:04.984
speak up for yourself.

406
00:24:05.684 --> 00:24:08.055
You can tell people what he did,

407
00:24:10.194 --> 00:24:11.724
and how it has been...

408
00:24:11.724 --> 00:24:13.424
so difficult until now.

409
00:24:18.234 --> 00:24:19.835
You said it's a nightmare, right?

410
00:24:22.105 --> 00:24:23.535
This is your chance.

411
00:24:25.704 --> 00:24:27.504
Escape from that nightmare.

412
00:24:35.855 --> 00:24:38.684
Ma Yi Deum is a cooperating attorney.

413
00:24:38.785 --> 00:24:40.855
CAGU is the department in charge.

414
00:24:42.795 --> 00:24:45.464
Don't let Mr. Kim go through the trouble.

415
00:24:45.494 --> 00:24:47.795
I need you...

416
00:24:48.135 --> 00:24:49.595
to take care of this.

417
00:24:51.434 --> 00:24:52.635
Yes, sir.

418
00:25:15.454 --> 00:25:17.024
If it gets too difficult for you,

419
00:25:17.724 --> 00:25:19.595
you can let us know even if we're midway in.

420
00:25:21.895 --> 00:25:22.895
Okay.

421
00:26:07.345 --> 00:26:08.474
I remember now.

422
00:26:12.285 --> 00:26:13.585
You changed a lot.

423
00:26:21.994 --> 00:26:23.724
We'll start.

424
00:26:29.994 --> 00:26:32.065
Yiwang had a fireworks festival.

425
00:26:32.905 --> 00:26:35.474
I went with my friends after the exams.

426
00:26:36.905 --> 00:26:38.504
We met on the second day of our trip.

427
00:26:39.774 --> 00:26:41.474
Do you remember anything about Hong Sun Hwa...

428
00:26:41.674 --> 00:26:43.145
from that time?

429
00:26:43.845 --> 00:26:44.984
Of course.

430
00:26:47.855 --> 00:26:50.815
She wore a white sweater with pearls on her neck.

431
00:26:52.184 --> 00:26:53.655
She was walking from afar,

432
00:26:53.984 --> 00:26:55.424
but she was so beautiful that she stood out.

433
00:26:56.555 --> 00:26:58.994
That's why I decided to strike a conversation.

434
00:27:00.895 --> 00:27:02.264
It was so long ago,

435
00:27:03.065 --> 00:27:04.934
but your memory is very detailed.

436
00:27:06.504 --> 00:27:07.704
Like I told you already,

437
00:27:08.375 --> 00:27:10.375
it was a good memory for me.

438
00:27:13.345 --> 00:27:15.514
We made campfire by the river.

439
00:27:17.145 --> 00:27:19.514
She was tired, so I walked her back.

440
00:27:21.984 --> 00:27:24.484
I believe it was called River Bed and Breakfast.

441
00:27:44.474 --> 00:27:47.345
It was about 10 minutes away from the river.

442
00:27:50.315 --> 00:27:51.315
She slowed down...

443
00:27:51.315 --> 00:27:53.014
as if she didn't want to go inside.

444
00:27:53.785 --> 00:27:55.855
I remember matching her pace...

445
00:27:56.184 --> 00:27:58.155
to make her feel good.

446
00:28:01.055 --> 00:28:02.924
(River, 10 minute walk, River Bed and Breakfast)

447
00:28:11.135 --> 00:28:12.865
After dropping her off,

448
00:28:12.934 --> 00:28:14.535
I was planning to leave.

449
00:28:14.774 --> 00:28:16.274
It was her...

450
00:28:17.575 --> 00:28:18.845
that stopped me.

451
00:28:19.474 --> 00:28:23.145
(River Bed and Breakfast)

452
00:28:23.145 --> 00:28:24.145
Go in.

453
00:28:25.484 --> 00:28:26.585
Wait.

454
00:28:29.655 --> 00:28:31.825
Can't you stay for a little while?

455
00:28:37.095 --> 00:28:38.095
Hong Sun Hwa.

456
00:28:40.365 --> 00:28:42.234
Is what he said true?

457
00:28:42.734 --> 00:28:43.764
No.

458
00:28:44.605 --> 00:28:45.704
Never.

459
00:28:46.035 --> 00:28:49.035
He suddenly attacked me by force.

460
00:28:49.934 --> 00:28:51.375
It must be hard,

461
00:28:52.305 --> 00:28:54.815
but please tell us in more detail.

462
00:29:00.214 --> 00:29:04.155
There was a lot of tall grass...

463
00:29:08.194 --> 00:29:09.254
Hey.

464
00:29:09.895 --> 00:29:11.125
Wait for me.

465
00:29:11.595 --> 00:29:12.664
I'm fine.

466
00:29:20.688 --> 00:29:23.920
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E12 Witch's Court "20 Years of Nightmare"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

467
00:29:31.815 --> 00:29:33.845
I heard crickets,

468
00:29:34.655 --> 00:29:36.655
and there was a cold breeze.

469
00:29:40.085 --> 00:29:42.694
It was dark for a while, and when I opened my eyes,

470
00:29:45.924 --> 00:29:48.365
I saw pink flame grass.

471
00:29:49.895 --> 00:29:51.135
Pink?

472
00:29:55.405 --> 00:29:58.845
- Ms. Son. Please confirm. - Okay.

473
00:30:05.815 --> 00:30:08.385
It started being imported five years ago.

474
00:30:16.024 --> 00:30:17.224
Are you sure?

475
00:30:18.565 --> 00:30:20.464
Are you sure that's what you saw?

476
00:30:23.035 --> 00:30:24.734
I'm sure they were pink.

477
00:30:25.464 --> 00:30:26.635
See?

478
00:30:27.305 --> 00:30:30.105
- She's talking nonsense. - Kim Hyung Soo.

479
00:30:35.974 --> 00:30:37.115
Ms. Hong.

480
00:30:38.815 --> 00:30:42.454
Don't you remember anything more specific?

481
00:30:43.484 --> 00:30:45.155
Well, just that...

482
00:30:46.085 --> 00:30:49.155
the breeze was kind of chilly...

483
00:30:49.825 --> 00:30:52.595
and there was a lot of grass.

484
00:30:54.934 --> 00:30:57.535
Around where was that?

485
00:30:58.605 --> 00:31:00.635
Where were you headed?

486
00:31:03.535 --> 00:31:05.575
I... I...

487
00:31:11.845 --> 00:31:13.085
I knew it.

488
00:31:13.744 --> 00:31:15.585
She keeps saying gibberish.

489
00:31:16.355 --> 00:31:18.684
If I really did it and she couldn't forget,

490
00:31:19.385 --> 00:31:20.785
she'd remember everything.

491
00:31:24.524 --> 00:31:27.194
Must I continue listening to her crazy talk?

492
00:31:27.194 --> 00:31:28.295
What was that?

493
00:31:29.035 --> 00:31:31.264
Are you saying I'm crazy and talking nonsense?

494
00:31:31.264 --> 00:31:32.434
Then what?

495
00:31:33.065 --> 00:31:35.704
You enjoyed it too, and now, you're accusing me.

496
00:31:37.335 --> 00:31:39.845
Are you trying to destroy my life?

497
00:31:40.004 --> 00:31:42.145
Look. You're out of line.

498
00:31:43.075 --> 00:31:44.075
Look.

499
00:31:46.045 --> 00:31:48.454
Destroy your life? Me?

500
00:31:49.285 --> 00:31:50.954
What about my life that you destroyed?

501
00:31:51.825 --> 00:31:54.355
For... For 20 years...

502
00:31:55.655 --> 00:31:58.524
Do you know how I've lived for the past 20 years?

503
00:31:59.664 --> 00:32:02.434
While you lived a happy, guilt-free life,

504
00:32:03.795 --> 00:32:05.135
I never once...

505
00:32:05.504 --> 00:32:08.035
I never once slept peacefully.

506
00:32:08.575 --> 00:32:11.375
But are you saying... Are you saying...

507
00:32:12.075 --> 00:32:14.974
I'm making this up to destroy your life?

508
00:32:15.414 --> 00:32:18.045
What? I'm talking nonsense?

509
00:32:18.244 --> 00:32:21.385
After... After how I've lived...

510
00:32:37.395 --> 00:32:39.464
I really didn't want to go this far,

511
00:32:40.934 --> 00:32:42.674
but my patience has run out.

512

(Medical History)

513
00:32:58.785 --> 00:33:05.024
(Anxiety and paranoia. Difficulty breathing)

514
00:33:12.734 --> 00:33:15.135
This woman always had mental problems,

515
00:33:16.204 --> 00:33:18.375
which is making her say such outrageous things.

516
00:33:23.474 --> 00:33:25.684
- No. - I've made myself clear.

517
00:33:26.845 --> 00:33:29.585
I had consensual intercourse.

518
00:33:29.885 --> 00:33:32.024
No.

519
00:33:32.125 --> 00:33:34.155
No. No. I...

520
00:33:34.424 --> 00:33:36.095
I...

521
00:33:36.795 --> 00:33:38.125
No.

522
00:33:38.295 --> 00:33:40.724
No. I... I didn't...

523
00:33:40.795 --> 00:33:43.694
I didn't.

524
00:33:44.335 --> 00:33:45.805
I didn't.

525
00:33:45.865 --> 00:33:48.174
Even if he is lying,

526
00:33:48.474 --> 00:33:50.575
Hong Sun Hwa's case did get weaker.

527
00:33:50.734 --> 00:33:53.274
How is her medical record available after 20 years?

528
00:33:53.474 --> 00:33:55.145
The requires them to be kept for only 10 years.

529
00:33:55.174 --> 00:33:56.974
That depends on the hospital.

530
00:33:57.315 --> 00:33:59.214
Based on her medical history that he submitted,

531
00:33:59.684 --> 00:34:02.684
if he claims she imagined it due to her depression,

532
00:34:03.655 --> 00:34:05.555
we'll have nothing to say to rebut that.

533
00:34:05.885 --> 00:34:07.724
Then we'll just find other evidence.

534
00:34:08.055 --> 00:34:09.595
Wasn't there another witness?

535
00:34:10.354 --> 00:34:11.524
Yes.

536
00:34:11.694 --> 00:34:14.225
- Good. Then let's... - Good work today.

537
00:34:14.734 --> 00:34:16.334
What? What the...

538
00:34:17.935 --> 00:34:19.035
Yeo.

539
00:34:21.774 --> 00:34:22.905
Ms. Son.

540
00:34:23.305 --> 00:34:25.044
It's me, Ma Yi Deum.

541
00:34:25.274 --> 00:34:26.905
- Ma. - Ms. son.

542
00:34:26.975 --> 00:34:28.714
- What about the witness? - Don't be like this.

543
00:34:28.714 --> 00:34:31.785
- She has no cell phone, - I'm going to call.

544
00:34:31.785 --> 00:34:34.655
- or credit cards. - I'll call Mr. Koo.

545
00:34:34.814 --> 00:34:37.754
I've been trying to track her, but it isn't easy.

546
00:34:38.655 --> 00:34:41.455
Please check with Immigration as well.

547
00:34:41.694 --> 00:34:42.725
Will do.

548
00:34:46.024 --> 00:34:47.095
That...

549
00:35:04.615 --> 00:35:06.245
(Lady Ko's birthday)

550
00:35:13.024 --> 00:35:15.424
What pretty flowers.

551
00:35:16.754 --> 00:35:19.325
Your son must've sent them again this year.

552
00:35:19.595 --> 00:35:21.064
You must be so happy.

553
00:35:21.394 --> 00:35:22.435
Thanks.

554
00:35:30.975 --> 00:35:33.245
(Happy birthday, Dr. Ko. KBS' writers)

(CAGU, Park Hoon Soo, Yeo Jin Wook)

556
00:35:48.225 --> 00:35:50.495
Hi Jin Wook, how have you been?

557
00:35:56.765 --> 00:35:57.834
Mr. Yeo.

558
00:35:58.635 --> 00:36:00.135
We found Choi Gyung Ja.

559
00:36:00.834 --> 00:36:03.174
She's a nurse at Naeil Long Term Care Facility,

560
00:36:03.305 --> 00:36:05.444
which is on Bujin Island.

561
00:36:06.705 --> 00:36:08.475
Let's leave an hour from now.

562
00:36:11.285 --> 00:36:12.345
Yes, sir.

563
00:36:23.024 --> 00:36:24.095
What are you doing?

564
00:36:24.894 --> 00:36:27.464
You're meeting a witness, right? I'll go with you.

565
00:36:27.865 --> 00:36:29.665
Get out. Mr. Koo's coming.

566
00:36:29.694 --> 00:36:32.464
No, he isn't. He knows I'll be going instead.

567
00:36:33.004 --> 00:36:35.305
I'll get her statement,

568
00:36:35.305 --> 00:36:37.274
and you can read it later.

569
00:36:37.274 --> 00:36:39.604
Must you tag along everywhere like this?

570
00:36:39.644 --> 00:36:41.115
- Yes. - What?

571
00:36:41.314 --> 00:36:43.575
I need to see and hear everything directly.

572
00:36:44.845 --> 00:36:45.915
Wake me up when we arrive.

573
00:37:18.245 --> 00:37:20.885
Is this it? Just a minute. I need the bathroom.

574
00:37:25.424 --> 00:37:26.955
Wait for me here.

575
00:37:29.794 --> 00:37:32.394
Hello. I'm here to see Choi Gyung Ja.

576
00:37:33.124 --> 00:37:34.794
Ms. Choi? Okay.

577
00:37:36.765 --> 00:37:38.905
Ms. Choi, you have a visitor.

578
00:37:48.874 --> 00:37:51.785
What... Ms. Choi.

579
00:37:57.155 --> 00:37:58.924
Oh my gosh. Look who's here.

580
00:37:59.354 --> 00:38:00.785
Jin Wook, is that you?

581
00:38:01.624 --> 00:38:02.655
Yes.

582
00:38:04.564 --> 00:38:06.365
So this is where you work?

583
00:38:08.635 --> 00:38:10.665
How long has it been?

584
00:38:10.964 --> 00:38:13.205
Last I saw you, you were a senior in high school.

585
00:38:13.365 --> 00:38:14.405
That's right.

586
00:38:15.535 --> 00:38:19.444
Why... Why did you quit so suddenly back then?

587
00:38:20.345 --> 00:38:21.814
I was so sad.

588
00:38:22.814 --> 00:38:23.944
Were you?

589
00:38:25.515 --> 00:38:27.955
Well... Back then,

590
00:38:27.955 --> 00:38:29.785
my little sister was very ill.

591
00:38:30.084 --> 00:38:32.385
I was the only person who could look after her.

592
00:38:32.624 --> 00:38:35.124
That's why I had to leave so suddenly.

593
00:38:36.124 --> 00:38:39.464
How's your mother? Is she doing well?

594
00:38:41.265 --> 00:38:42.265
Yes.

595
00:38:42.694 --> 00:38:44.635
What brings you here?

596
00:38:44.935 --> 00:38:46.035
Yeo.

597
00:38:49.575 --> 00:38:50.834
I almost died.

598
00:38:53.004 --> 00:38:54.475
Let me introduce you.

599
00:38:54.515 --> 00:38:56.345
She's Ma Yi Deum, a prosecutor...

600
00:38:56.975 --> 00:38:58.944
I mean, a lawyer.

601
00:38:59.584 --> 00:39:01.155
She's a nurse...

602
00:39:01.155 --> 00:39:02.515
that I knew from years ago.

603
00:39:11.294 --> 00:39:13.995
Do you remember this person?

604
00:39:21.035 --> 00:39:23.334
Yes, I do remember.

605
00:39:24.905 --> 00:39:26.944
I was working...

606
00:39:27.615 --> 00:39:30.644
at a general hospital at the time.

607
00:39:46.165 --> 00:39:47.165
Hey.

608
00:39:47.524 --> 00:39:48.665
Excuse me.

609
00:39:50.365 --> 00:39:52.765
Hey. Miss.

610
00:39:53.165 --> 00:39:56.874
(Emergency Room)

611
00:40:05.745 --> 00:40:07.885
What's her condition?

612
00:40:07.885 --> 00:40:09.754
I suspect she's been raped.

613
00:40:09.754 --> 00:40:11.885
She's bleeding as well, so please tend to her.

614
00:40:12.624 --> 00:40:14.294
Can you repeat...

615
00:40:14.595 --> 00:40:16.825
what you said in court?

616
00:40:17.794 --> 00:40:19.424
Of course, I must.

617
00:40:20.595 --> 00:40:23.734
You say she's been hurting for so long.

618
00:40:25.104 --> 00:40:27.165
Yes. We're done,

619
00:40:27.165 --> 00:40:28.205
so let's go.

620
00:40:29.575 --> 00:40:30.635
You came a long way.

621
00:40:30.635 --> 00:40:32.305
Why don't you eat first?

622
00:40:32.305 --> 00:40:34.745
No. We came a long way, so we should go.

623
00:40:34.745 --> 00:40:36.015
Even if we leave now,

624
00:40:36.015 --> 00:40:37.885
we have to wait a few hours for the boat.

625
00:40:37.885 --> 00:40:39.345
That's right.

626
00:40:39.515 --> 00:40:40.584
You're here anyway.

627
00:40:40.584 --> 00:40:42.155
Stay for lunch.

628
00:40:42.155 --> 00:40:44.254
The food is very good here.

629
00:40:47.024 --> 00:40:48.024
It's not bad, right?

630
00:40:50.155 --> 00:40:51.165
Nope.

631
00:40:59.104 --> 00:41:00.305
I don't want this.

632
00:41:01.435 --> 00:41:02.535
You eat it.

633
00:41:08.745 --> 00:41:10.015
Let me do it.

634
00:41:10.015 --> 00:41:12.345
No. It's okay.

635
00:41:12.345 --> 00:41:13.644
Go and eat.

636
00:41:13.644 --> 00:41:15.714
I finished eating already.

637
00:41:21.124 --> 00:41:22.595
You're still so nice.

638
00:41:22.595 --> 00:41:25.524
You haven't changed one bit.

639
00:41:27.495 --> 00:41:28.935
Even back then,

640
00:41:29.794 --> 00:41:33.265
you helped a lot with hospital errands.

641
00:41:33.265 --> 00:41:36.734
I was just trying to get credit for volunteering.

642
00:41:40.205 --> 00:41:41.444
Jin Wook.

643
00:41:42.274 --> 00:41:44.015
That lady...

644
00:41:44.385 --> 00:41:46.015
looks familiar.

645
00:41:50.285 --> 00:41:53.055
I feel like I've seen her a lot before.

646
00:41:54.394 --> 00:41:55.394
Do you...

647
00:41:56.095 --> 00:41:57.964
remember that woman?

648
00:41:58.825 --> 00:42:00.995
The woman who saved you and me...

649
00:42:01.394 --> 00:42:03.064
when the hospital...

650
00:42:03.294 --> 00:42:04.734
was on fire.

651
00:42:08.374 --> 00:42:09.674
She's her daughter.

652
00:42:13.044 --> 00:42:14.374
I see.

653
00:42:17.915 --> 00:42:19.785
I only recently found out myself.

654
00:42:26.725 --> 00:42:29.394
Wait. Ms. Ma.

655
00:42:30.055 --> 00:42:31.194
Just a minute.

656
00:42:33.495 --> 00:42:34.635
Here.

657
00:42:34.834 --> 00:42:36.834
I dried them myself.

658
00:42:36.834 --> 00:42:37.905
I saw...

659
00:42:37.905 --> 00:42:40.265
that you seemed to enjoy burdock tea.

660
00:42:40.405 --> 00:42:42.234
You don't need to.

661
00:42:42.234 --> 00:42:43.674
You feel like my daughter.

662
00:42:44.274 --> 00:42:45.805
Like my niece, that's why.

663
00:42:45.805 --> 00:42:48.214
Here. Just take it.

664
00:42:48.214 --> 00:42:49.714
Thank you.

665
00:42:50.314 --> 00:42:51.814
I'll call you when I get back.

666
00:42:51.814 --> 00:42:52.944
Okay.

667
00:42:53.584 --> 00:42:55.415
Drive safely, okay, Jin Wook?

668
00:44:04.185 --> 00:44:07.354
That nurse that we met...

669
00:44:07.995 --> 00:44:10.055
Is she always this nice...

670
00:44:10.055 --> 00:44:11.394
to people she doesn't know?

671
00:44:12.365 --> 00:44:13.365
Why?

672
00:44:16.865 --> 00:44:18.405
I'm appreciative,

673
00:44:19.064 --> 00:44:20.405
but I feel bad.

674
00:44:21.705 --> 00:44:24.205
It's probably because she's thankful and sorry.

675
00:44:25.905 --> 00:44:27.575
14 years ago,

676
00:44:27.575 --> 00:44:28.714
there was a fire...

677
00:44:28.714 --> 00:44:30.475
at Sena Mental Hospital.

678
00:44:31.214 --> 00:44:34.185
When it broke out, she and I were stuck...

679
00:44:34.185 --> 00:44:36.115
in the laundry room.

680
00:44:37.955 --> 00:44:40.584
Everyone was escaping frantically,

681
00:44:41.155 --> 00:44:43.024
but one patient opened the door...

682
00:44:43.024 --> 00:44:44.495
and saved us.

683
00:44:48.234 --> 00:44:49.865
Your mother.

684
00:44:50.935 --> 00:44:53.135
She saved us both.

685
00:44:55.504 --> 00:44:58.174
My mom was such a busybody.

686
00:45:00.544 --> 00:45:02.575
Who was she to save anyone?

687
00:45:05.584 --> 00:45:06.615
Sure.

688
00:45:07.484 --> 00:45:08.754
That's so like her.

689
00:45:10.115 --> 00:45:11.785
That's how I felt too, back then.

690
00:45:12.854 --> 00:45:14.825
I was so thankful and sorry...

691
00:45:15.524 --> 00:45:17.155
that I wanted to do something. Anything.

692
00:45:18.765 --> 00:45:20.995
That's why I went to Janghyeon-dong.

693
00:45:24.865 --> 00:45:26.564
I still feel the same now.

694
00:45:28.504 --> 00:45:31.245
I will do whatever it takes to catch...

695
00:45:32.544 --> 00:45:34.245
the people who did that to your mother...

696
00:45:35.115 --> 00:45:36.374
and make them pay.

697
00:45:36.374 --> 00:45:37.714
Regardless of who it is.

698
00:45:38.345 --> 00:45:39.845
Regardless of who it is?

699
00:45:41.955 --> 00:45:42.955
Yes.

700
00:45:46.584 --> 00:45:47.595
Fine.

701
00:45:48.254 --> 00:45:49.955
I can accept an apology,

702
00:45:51.694 --> 00:45:53.694
but I have no intention of forgiving.

703
00:46:22.854 --> 00:46:23.854
What are you doing there?

704
00:46:24.765 --> 00:46:26.595
Hi, Gyung Ja.

705
00:46:34.535 --> 00:46:36.135
(Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office)

706
00:46:36.975 --> 00:46:38.874
Do you still have more to investigate?

707
00:46:39.774 --> 00:46:42.274
You saw for yourself that she was full of it.

708
00:46:43.944 --> 00:46:45.644
This is the statement by the witness...

709
00:46:45.644 --> 00:46:47.984
who found Hong Sun Hwa who was unconscious.

710
00:46:48.915 --> 00:46:50.385
(Witness Statement)

711
00:46:51.825 --> 00:46:52.825
So?

712
00:46:52.924 --> 00:46:54.354
It was long ago,

713
00:46:54.624 --> 00:46:57.194
but because Hong Sun Hwa was in such a bad state,

714
00:46:57.865 --> 00:46:59.794
the witness remembers clearly.

715
00:47:00.524 --> 00:47:02.765
How could you say that after listening to her?

716
00:47:03.834 --> 00:47:05.964
She said she saw pink flame grass.

717
00:47:09.135 --> 00:47:11.575
You believed her and met with a witness?

718
00:47:11.575 --> 00:47:14.475
I thought what she said didn't make sense either.

719
00:47:16.345 --> 00:47:17.345
But...

720
00:47:20.515 --> 00:47:22.854
(Yiwang Fireworks Show)

721
00:47:23.285 --> 00:47:25.225
Based on the witness' statement,

722
00:47:25.225 --> 00:47:27.754
this was made for the fireworks show.

723
00:47:28.794 --> 00:47:30.254
It's consistent with...

724
00:47:31.265 --> 00:47:32.524
Hong Sun Hwa's statement.

725
00:47:34.435 --> 00:47:35.834
There must be a mistake.

726
00:47:35.894 --> 00:47:37.234
Are you sure?

727
00:47:37.234 --> 00:47:39.464
I wouldn't force someone who didn't want it.

728
00:47:39.464 --> 00:47:40.834
Think about it again.

729
00:47:40.834 --> 00:47:42.174
I can think about it again and again,

730
00:47:43.305 --> 00:47:44.644
but my statement remains the same.

731
00:47:44.944 --> 00:47:45.975
I only remember...

732
00:47:46.144 --> 00:47:47.774
both of us enjoying ourselves.

733
00:47:47.774 --> 00:47:49.714
You saw her face the other day, didn't you?

734
00:47:50.475 --> 00:47:52.584
If she enjoyed herself, would she react that way?

735
00:47:52.584 --> 00:47:55.584
You're being too biased in your investigation.

736
00:47:57.685 --> 00:47:59.385
If you're done, may I go?

737
00:48:00.155 --> 00:48:01.354
I'm a busy man.

738
00:48:26.084 --> 00:48:27.185
I am...

739
00:48:27.714 --> 00:48:30.185
giving you an opportunity, Mr. Kim.

740
00:48:31.254 --> 00:48:33.584
An opportunity to confess and reduce your sentence.

741
00:48:35.354 --> 00:48:36.354
No.

742
00:48:37.194 --> 00:48:38.595
I'm done talking.

743
00:48:46.905 --> 00:48:48.035
Heo Yoon Kyung speaking.

744
00:48:48.035 --> 00:48:49.205
This is Kim Hyung Soo.

745
00:48:49.805 --> 00:48:51.674
I think things have gotten complicated.

746
00:48:51.674 --> 00:48:53.805
We've helped plenty, I believe.

747
00:48:53.805 --> 00:48:55.115
Please talk to the mayor and...

748
00:48:55.115 --> 00:48:57.115
I'm relaying the mayor's message.

749
00:49:09.725 --> 00:49:11.024
The mayor is out.

750
00:49:11.024 --> 00:49:12.365
- Mr. Mayor! - He's out.

751
00:49:12.394 --> 00:49:14.265
- Mr. Mayor! - Stop!

752
00:49:17.095 --> 00:49:19.834
Mr. Mayor. Will you really throw me away?

753
00:49:25.174 --> 00:49:26.245
Say hi.

754
00:49:28.214 --> 00:49:30.444
This is my new spokesperson.

755
00:50:07.955 --> 00:50:09.285
You know who I am, right?

756
00:50:10.214 --> 00:50:12.354
Then you must know what I want.

757
00:50:15.325 --> 00:50:17.455
Call me if you want to make a deal.

758
00:50:51.294 --> 00:50:52.964
This isn't the place.

759
00:50:54.894 --> 00:50:57.635
Not here. That way. Let's go.

760
00:50:58.464 --> 00:50:59.734
This way.

761
00:51:02.475 --> 00:51:04.374
We can't talk about this here.

762
00:51:04.705 --> 00:51:05.905
Let's talk there.

763
00:51:07.475 --> 00:51:09.044
Let's go.

764
00:51:15.155 --> 00:51:16.915
- Here? - Yes. Here.

765
00:51:19.155 --> 00:51:20.555
What did you bring?

766
00:51:21.794 --> 00:51:23.124
Show it to me.

767
00:51:23.254 --> 00:51:25.964
No. You should go first.

768
00:51:26.365 --> 00:51:28.365
You're not a prosecutor anymore.

769
00:51:28.935 --> 00:51:30.765
Is there anything you can do for me?

770
00:51:32.165 --> 00:51:34.374
We'll agree with a letter of leniency.

771
00:51:34.874 --> 00:51:37.405
We'll say you settled with the victim,

772
00:51:37.405 --> 00:51:39.674
and get you off with probation or a fine.

773
00:51:40.575 --> 00:51:41.674
Do you mean it?

774
00:51:42.374 --> 00:51:43.944
You have to.

775
00:51:44.814 --> 00:51:46.084
From the looks of it,

776
00:51:46.584 --> 00:51:48.854
I'll end up in prison without it.

777
00:51:49.655 --> 00:51:52.055
It depends on what you give me.

778
00:51:55.325 --> 00:51:58.464
I have evidence that will be fatal to Cho Gap Soo.

779
00:52:00.825 --> 00:52:02.234
Ahn Suh Rim.

780
00:52:02.734 --> 00:52:04.095
His wife.

781
00:52:11.205 --> 00:52:14.004
Based on the evidence and testimonies thus far,

782
00:52:14.674 --> 00:52:17.714
the defendant's crimes seem to be evident.

783
00:52:18.314 --> 00:52:20.845
Would you like to say anything further?

784
00:52:41.874 --> 00:52:43.004
Your Honor.

785
00:52:43.635 --> 00:52:46.345
I've obeyed the law every day of my life.

786
00:52:46.674 --> 00:52:48.314
I don't even litter on the street.

787
00:52:49.314 --> 00:52:51.444
If I really did in fact do what is asserted,

788
00:52:51.515 --> 00:52:53.984
I'd apologize and accept punishment accordingly.

789
00:52:54.584 --> 00:52:57.515
But I do not think my memory is flawed.

790
00:52:58.955 --> 00:53:00.995
Please, I beg that you will render...

791
00:53:01.725 --> 00:53:03.225
a wise decision.

792
00:53:04.424 --> 00:53:05.964
Okay.

793
00:53:06.725 --> 00:53:09.035
We will consider the defendant's statement,

794
00:53:09.294 --> 00:53:11.365
and render a decision thoughtfully.

795
00:53:12.004 --> 00:53:13.165
Your Honor.

796
00:53:13.935 --> 00:53:17.004
I'm the victim's attorney. I'd like to say something.

797
00:53:18.044 --> 00:53:19.444
Yes, go ahead.

798
00:53:26.685 --> 00:53:29.214
I'd like to submit a very important document...

799
00:53:29.314 --> 00:53:30.814
related to this case.

800
00:53:50.004 --> 00:53:51.975
Is all of this true?

801
00:53:52.345 --> 00:53:53.644
Yes, it is.

802
00:53:54.515 --> 00:53:58.245
This lays out reasons why the victim requests...

803
00:53:59.245 --> 00:54:01.915
a severe punishment against the defendant.

804
00:54:05.084 --> 00:54:06.685
Your Honor,

805
00:54:07.285 --> 00:54:09.555
as the victim's counsel,

806
00:54:10.055 --> 00:54:12.564
I heard how the victim lived since the incident.

807
00:54:13.064 --> 00:54:15.935
The victim spent the past 20 years...

808
00:54:16.294 --> 00:54:18.964
paused at November 22, 1997,

809
00:54:19.334 --> 00:54:21.905
the day of the incident.

810
00:54:22.805 --> 00:54:24.274
She had forfeited...

811
00:54:24.705 --> 00:54:28.615
her life as a human being and as an ordinary woman.

812
00:54:29.575 --> 00:54:30.714
Now is the time...

813
00:54:31.185 --> 00:54:34.185
to give the victim a chance to live.

814
00:54:34.754 --> 00:54:36.515
In order for that to happen,

815
00:54:37.584 --> 00:54:40.995
that man sitting there must be punished.

816
00:54:42.254 --> 00:54:43.595
What are you doing?

817
00:54:44.124 --> 00:54:45.624
This isn't what you promised!

818
00:54:46.325 --> 00:54:47.995
You have to.

819
00:54:48.834 --> 00:54:50.135
From the looks of it,

820
00:54:50.595 --> 00:54:52.734
I'll end up in prison without it.

821
00:54:55.435 --> 00:54:57.745
The defendant asked me yesterday...

822
00:54:58.075 --> 00:55:01.615
to get the victim to sign a letter of leniency.

823
00:55:03.174 --> 00:55:04.984
If he couldn't remember anything,

824
00:55:04.984 --> 00:55:06.785
would he have done that?

825
00:55:08.655 --> 00:55:12.024
He remembers everything but claims ignorance!

826
00:55:12.024 --> 00:55:14.155
He is shameless and shows no remorse!

827
00:55:15.655 --> 00:55:19.024
Thus, we request the court to punish him severely.

828
00:55:23.194 --> 00:55:26.104
In contrast to the victim, who suffered for years,

829
00:55:26.104 --> 00:55:28.205
unable to recuperate from the crime committed,

830
00:55:28.635 --> 00:55:30.305
the defendant does not repent for his crime,

831
00:55:30.575 --> 00:55:33.374
and lived comfortably without any guilt.

832
00:55:33.674 --> 00:55:36.044
Thus, he deserves adequate punishment.

833
00:55:36.674 --> 00:55:39.484
Thus, the defendant Kim Hyung Soo...

834
00:55:39.885 --> 00:55:42.185
is sentenced to five years in prison.

835
00:55:46.225 --> 00:55:47.325
Good job.

836
00:55:54.834 --> 00:55:56.595
Thank you, ma'am.

837
00:55:56.964 --> 00:55:58.035
Sure.

838
00:55:58.435 --> 00:56:00.435
Thanks to you, I can...

839
00:56:01.705 --> 00:56:03.975
finally live like a normal human being.

840
00:56:05.405 --> 00:56:07.274
I feel much more at peace now.

841
00:56:09.075 --> 00:56:11.115
I guess what I've wanted all these years...

842
00:56:11.345 --> 00:56:13.944
was to see that man get punished.

843
00:56:16.084 --> 00:56:17.584
Thank you very much.

844
00:56:19.185 --> 00:56:20.285
Mom!

845
00:56:28.035 --> 00:56:29.194
You did great.

846
00:57:24.584 --> 00:57:25.685
Ms. Ma.

847
00:57:31.394 --> 00:57:32.624
You did great.

848
00:57:33.024 --> 00:57:35.564
I just... I only did my job.

849
00:57:36.365 --> 00:57:37.765
You know,

850
00:57:38.305 --> 00:57:40.135
being a victim's attorney suits you.

851
00:57:41.035 --> 00:57:42.604
I look forward to your help in the future.

852
00:57:43.174 --> 00:57:45.944
There will be no "in the future."

853
00:57:46.745 --> 00:57:49.444
You seem to be confused.

854
00:57:49.444 --> 00:57:52.515
You know, I don't like assisting others.

855
00:57:52.685 --> 00:57:55.555
Plus, the prosecutor takes all the glory.

856
00:57:55.655 --> 00:57:57.825
All I get from it is a few hundred bucks.

857
00:57:58.584 --> 00:58:00.084
Then what will you do now?

858
00:58:00.655 --> 00:58:01.694
Hold on.

859
00:58:02.495 --> 00:58:03.624
Hello, Ms. Min.

860
00:58:04.325 --> 00:58:05.765
I'll come in right away.

861
00:58:06.995 --> 00:58:09.394
What else? I should be a prosecutor.

862
00:58:11.564 --> 00:58:12.705
Just you wait.

863
00:58:12.865 --> 00:58:16.674
I'll return to being a prosecutor above you...

864
00:58:16.674 --> 00:58:19.805
and rearrange that brain of yours.

865
00:58:22.044 --> 00:58:24.075
Okay. I'll be waiting.

866
00:58:39.095 --> 00:58:42.535
(Cho Gap Soo's case)

867
00:58:42.535 --> 00:58:44.834
Cho Gap Soo makes connections using...

868
00:58:44.905 --> 00:58:46.464
women and lobbying.

869
00:58:47.234 --> 00:58:50.004
I'll get a list of people who visited that place...

870
00:58:50.774 --> 00:58:52.604
and gather evidence of sexual service received,

871
00:58:54.174 --> 00:58:55.475
and catch Cho Gap Soo.

872
00:58:57.885 --> 00:58:59.245
Where is "that place"?

873
00:59:01.015 --> 00:59:02.115
Kingdom.

874
00:59:04.555 --> 00:59:06.455
(Cho Gap Soo's case)

875
00:59:10.754 --> 00:59:12.924
