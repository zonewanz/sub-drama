00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.500
(Episode 29)

2
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.100
This is Patrol Car Four from Sangku Division.

3
00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:11.500
We got a call about an abduction case.

4
00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:12.900
The rooftop of Hae Kwang Law Firm in moguk-dong.

5
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.439
Send an ambulance and a patrol car.

6
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.140
Can we trust the person who called?

7
00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:20.110
Yes. We have to get there in five minutes.

8
00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.600
Sir, I need to get there as soon as possible.

9
00:01:07.589 --> 00:01:08.759
This shot...

10
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.559
will paralyze all the muscles in your body.

11
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.759
Then you won't be able to breathe,

12
00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:19.900
and you'll die quietly in five minutes as if you're falling asleep.

13
00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.309
Your death will be like a blessing.

14
00:01:29.809 --> 00:01:31.150
What time is it now?

15
00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:34.920
What time is it?

16
00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:37.089
And where am I now?

17
00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:42.159
Do you want to know where and what time you're going to die?

18
00:01:43.589 --> 00:01:45.900
This is the rooftop of Hae Kwang Law Firm, and it's...

19
00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:47.629
10:30pm right now.

20
00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.640
Jae Chan.

21
00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:56.510
Did you hear that?

22
00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.680
You heard that, right?

23
00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:00.640
It's...

24
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.559
What an interesting girl.

25
00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.629
Is this broken? Why isn't it working?

26
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.390
What...

27
00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:53.760
What is the matter?

28
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.629
How can we get to the rooftop?

29
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.730
The elevators aren't working due to the power outage.

30
00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.969
Oh, our emergency elevator is over there.

31
00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:04.539
Let me borrow your flashlight.

32
00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.390
What's wrong?

33
00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:21.390
You look scary.

34
00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:25.629
You look like you could kill me.

35
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.330
Yes.

36
00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:29.670
I'm about to.

37
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.640
Are you saying you'll become a murderer?

38
00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:38.210
No, of course not.

39
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.039
I'm saying that I need to clean up the garbage.

40
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.849
You tried to kill that reporter...

41
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.849
as well as me.

42
00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.260
I ended up killing you while trying to stop you,

43
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.060
which means I did it in defense of a third party,

44
00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.900
I'll get a non-guilty verdict.

45
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.370
You're the one who told me...

46
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.140
to sort it out well...

47
00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.270
and to make sure that it's a win-win deal for everyone.

48
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.179
This is the answer I found.

49
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.159
Woo Tak. It must be there. Over there.

50
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.279
Hong Joo!

51
00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:50.810
She's Ms. Nam Hong Joo, right?

52
00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.529
Gosh, what happened?

53
00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.500
My goodness, what's going on? Sir, are you all right?

54
00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:14.599
I'm okay, but please check on Ms. Nam.

55
00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:26.650
Hong Joo!

56
00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:30.190
- I can feel her pulse. - Lay her down.

57
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.219
Sorry?

58
00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:35.529
Whether she has a pulse or not isn't an issue.

59
00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:37.089
She can't breathe as her lungs are paralyzed.

60
00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:39.200
- What? - Explain her condition...

61
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.760
to the medics and tell them to bring a respirator.

62
00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:41.760
Okay.

63
00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:45.739
Hong Joo. Hong Joo, please.

64
00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:48.770
Please hang in there.

65
00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.440
Please...

66
00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.349
Hong Joo, please...

67
00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:10.789
Hong Joo.

68
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:12.900
Wake up.

69
00:06:28.179 --> 00:06:30.250
Wake up!

70
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:32.549
Hey!

71
00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:34.919
Hong Joo.

72
00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:37.120
Hang in there, please.

73
00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:15.229
(Episode 29: Stand by Me)

74
00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:17.589
(Episode 29: Stand by Me)

75
00:07:34.779 --> 00:07:35.979
Are you okay?

76
00:07:37.349 --> 00:07:40.750
Yes. I'm a little dizzy, but I'm all right.

77
00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:42.690
We're from Hangang Police Station.

78
00:07:43.289 --> 00:07:46.390
Could you please tell us what happened?

79
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:51.529
I met Ms. Nam in my office for an interview,

80
00:07:51.529 --> 00:07:53.760
and we had coffee together.

81
00:07:54.729 --> 00:07:56.969
I suddenly started feeling weak all over.

82
00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.039
Someone must've put some kind of drug in it.

83
00:08:07.409 --> 00:08:09.510
I was feeling all hazy, but I did see...

84
00:08:09.809 --> 00:08:13.350
the woman, Ha Ju Won, carrying Ms. Nam out of my office.

85
00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:15.890
I tried to stop her,

86
00:08:16.319 --> 00:08:18.520
but I couldn't really move because of the drug.

87
00:08:18.689 --> 00:08:22.390
Ha Ju Won is the woman who fell to death, right?

88
00:08:23.459 --> 00:08:26.760
Yes. She came to see me a little while ago.

89
00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:30.029
She insisted that she's the real IV drip serial killer.

90
00:08:30.329 --> 00:08:31.870
She came to consult me.

91
00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:33.970
The one who got caught isn't the real killer?

92
00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.140
That's right.

93
00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:37.709
My goodness.

94
00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:39.640
I suggested turning herself in,

95
00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:41.740
but she didn't take my advice.

96
00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:45.110
I guess she saw me meeting with Ms. Nam...

97
00:08:45.819 --> 00:08:48.590
and assumed that I was leaking the information to the media.

98
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:51.189
That's why you think she drugged your coffee?

99
00:08:51.419 --> 00:08:53.490
Well, that's what I'm speculating.

100
00:08:53.819 --> 00:08:56.090
Then what happened after that?

101
00:08:56.329 --> 00:08:59.529
I didn't have any strength to move, but I wasn't totally unconscious.

102
00:09:00.529 --> 00:09:02.600
I thought I should stop her from killing another person at all costs,

103
00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:06.270
so I barely managed to follow them to the rooftop,

104
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.010
- No! - but Ha Ju Won was already...

105
00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:10.309
drugging Ms. Nam.

106
00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:14.480
I wanted to stop her, but I couldn't move because of the drug.

107
00:09:15.279 --> 00:09:18.279
Then Ha Ju Won started attacking me immediately.

108
00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:23.350
While trying to stop her,

109
00:09:23.449 --> 00:09:27.020
she and I tussled. I ended up pushing her,

110
00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.090
and she fell off the building.

111
00:09:30.689 --> 00:09:33.360
After that, you fainted while trying...

112
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.630
to rescue Ms. Nam.

113
00:09:34.799 --> 00:09:35.829
That's right.

114
00:09:38.699 --> 00:09:40.900
If only I hadn't been drugged,

115
00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:43.770
I would've been able to save Ms. Nam's life.

116
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:46.980
Please don't worry. She's fine.

117
00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:56.720
She's fine?

118
00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:59.419
Are you saying she's alive?

119
00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.059
Yes, she's alive.

120
00:10:03.429 --> 00:10:04.459
How...

121
00:10:05.199 --> 00:10:08.059
I heard that drug kills anyone within five minutes of injection.

122
00:10:08.199 --> 00:10:10.329
Yes. Everyone is saying that it's a miracle.

123
00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:12.770
I heard that she would've died if she had been rescued a minute late.

124
00:10:13.569 --> 00:10:16.610
Prosecutor Jung Jae Chan saved her life by performing CPR promptly.

125
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:18.309
Prosecutor Jung Jae Chan?

126
00:10:18.679 --> 00:10:20.439
He came to the scene?

127
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:21.709
She was very lucky.

128
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:24.279
Lady Luck must've been on her side.

129
00:10:28.079 --> 00:10:29.090
Totally.

130
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:32.860
I'm so relieved.

131
00:10:58.679 --> 00:11:01.850
Doctor, how's Hong Joo? How is she?

132
00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:03.250
She passed the critical stage.

133
00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:05.789
She could survive thanks to the prompt first-aid treatment.

134
00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.360
But the thing is that I can't tell you for certain...

135
00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:13.230
when she'll regain her consciousness.

136
00:11:13.559 --> 00:11:14.829
What do you mean?

137
00:11:15.169 --> 00:11:16.829
She couldn't breathe for a significant amount of time.

138
00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:19.600
No oxygen was provided to her brain during that time,

139
00:11:19.699 --> 00:11:22.140
and the experience must've caused severe psychological trauma as well.

140
00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:25.679
We can't really predict anything at the moment.

141
00:11:26.409 --> 00:11:27.439
Ms. Yoon.

142
00:11:28.279 --> 00:11:30.250
I'm all right. I'm okay.

143
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:31.480
I'm sorry. I...

144
00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:33.579
I should've rescued her sooner.

145
00:11:33.779 --> 00:11:36.819
No, don't say that. Thank you. You saved her life.

146
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:39.459
I'm glad that she's alive. She could've died, you know.

147
00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:41.159
Don't worry.

148
00:11:41.829 --> 00:11:43.289
Hong Joo will regain her consciousness.

149
00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.529
She'll wake up as if nothing happened.

150
00:12:12.659 --> 00:12:13.760
How's Hong Joo?

151
00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:15.959
The doctor said that she has passed the critical stage,

152
00:12:17.059 --> 00:12:18.730
but she's still unconscious.

153
00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.659
I just...

154
00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:25.470
heard what Lawyer Lee Yu Beom said.

155
00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:28.539
What did he say?

156
00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:33.480
I think he'll insist that it was done in defense.

157
00:12:41.049 --> 00:12:42.419
Where is he now?

158
00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:44.150
Is he in the emergency room?

159
00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:46.819
Jae Chan.

160
00:12:53.329 --> 00:12:54.329
Mr. Choi.

161
00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:03.809
Why...

162
00:13:04.439 --> 00:13:05.640
Why on earth...

163
00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:07.779
Why do you have to do this?

164
00:13:09.909 --> 00:13:11.709
Why do you have to leave so suddenly?

165
00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:13.850
Why at a time like this?

166
00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.150
Why does it have to be at a time like this?

167
00:13:18.449 --> 00:13:19.459
I...

168
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:23.059
You're leaving me...

169
00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:25.500
all alone.

170
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.799
Why do you have to leave me?

171
00:13:32.539 --> 00:13:33.539
Why...

172
00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:41.779
Mr. Choi.

173
00:13:42.679 --> 00:13:44.480
I'm sorry, Mr. Jung.

174
00:14:02.829 --> 00:14:04.699
No one knows that you quit.

175
00:14:05.299 --> 00:14:07.500
Ms. Moon also said that she won't tell anyone.

176
00:14:08.439 --> 00:14:10.510
Just think that you're taking a few days off.

177
00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:12.140
When you come back...

178
00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:13.640
I won't go back.

179
00:14:16.309 --> 00:14:18.079
I'm going to be working at Hae Kwang Law Firm.

180
00:14:21.179 --> 00:14:23.419
Did you quit to work with Yu Beom?

181
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:25.150
Yes.

182
00:14:26.059 --> 00:14:27.689
But... Why?

183
00:14:33.199 --> 00:14:34.630
A long time ago,

184
00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:39.970
my brother ran away from the military armed.

185
00:14:46.039 --> 00:14:48.650
Whenever he called me to tell me that he couldn't take it,

186
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:51.350
- I have to go. - I said everyone puts up with it...

187
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.880
and that the experience would mature him.

188
00:14:54.419 --> 00:14:56.120
I just scolded him like that.

189
00:14:57.319 --> 00:14:59.419
I never really listened to him.

190
00:15:02.659 --> 00:15:03.959
I felt so bad about it.

191
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.260
I felt horrible that I never listened.

192
00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:11.270
So when he came to me after escaping,

193
00:15:12.799 --> 00:15:16.039
persuading him to turn himself in wasn't the first thing I thought.

194
00:15:17.409 --> 00:15:20.279
He must've been starving, so my priority was getting him food.

195
00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:32.260
When I heard that he killed my chief...

196
00:15:33.319 --> 00:15:35.429
and took other people's lives,

197
00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:46.100
I wanted to kill myself.

198
00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.270
I thought that I connived.

199
00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.179
Why now?

200
00:15:56.179 --> 00:15:57.449
You had a lot of time.

201
00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:00.620
You should've told me when we first met. Then it would've been easier.

202
00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:03.350
What do you want me to do now? Do you want my forgiveness?

203
00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:04.819
Or do you want me to hate you more?

204
00:16:04.819 --> 00:16:05.819
Neither.

205
00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
You asked me why I'm going to Hae Kwang Law Firm.

206
00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:13.360
I'm just answering your question.

207
00:16:18.169 --> 00:16:20.240
I no longer want to be a conniver.

208
00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:24.309
I must not feign ignorance to any wrongdoing like I did back then.

209
00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:31.749
That's why I quit. There are no other reasons.

210
00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:32.850
Mr. Choi.

211
00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:35.590
Don't do anything rash, Mr. Jung.

212
00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:38.390
Going to see Lawyer Lee now to question him...

213
00:16:38.989 --> 00:16:40.560
is nothing but a rash decision.

214
00:16:40.759 --> 00:16:43.090
Such an impetuous attitude won't get you anywhere.

215
00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:45.499
From the investigation to the trial,

216
00:16:45.999 --> 00:16:47.600
you won't be able to do anything.

217
00:16:52.239 --> 00:16:53.699
Now, make a choice.

218
00:16:53.999 --> 00:16:55.969
Will you go punch him now...

219
00:16:56.209 --> 00:16:58.810
and get excluded from the investigation and legal proceedings?

220
00:16:59.179 --> 00:17:00.939
Or will you just suck it up now...

221
00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:03.380
so that you can give him the punch he deserves...

222
00:17:05.219 --> 00:17:06.749
through the investigation and trial later on?

223
00:17:21.773 --> 00:17:25.005
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E29 While You Were Sleeping "Stand by Me"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

224
00:17:39.919 --> 00:17:41.650
How did you know that I'd be here?

225
00:17:47.659 --> 00:17:49.729
I just knew it. Something told me...

226
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:53.330
that you'll be kicked out and won't be able to do anything...

227
00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:56.900
if you go see Lawyer Lee now and cause a scene. I'm quite intuitive.

228
00:17:59.499 --> 00:18:02.239
Why? Do you think that I'm talking nonsense?

229
00:18:04.709 --> 00:18:05.709
No.

230
00:18:07.009 --> 00:18:08.780
I don't think that it's nonsense.

231
00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:13.850
I won't...

232
00:18:16.419 --> 00:18:17.719
act rashly.

233
00:18:22.189 --> 00:18:23.259
Good.

234
00:18:26.759 --> 00:18:29.229
That's what you should do as Chief Jung's son.

235
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:38.679
I really wanted to meet you again.

236
00:18:40.239 --> 00:18:41.610
Chief Jung's son.

237
00:19:27.189 --> 00:19:29.030
About the trailer arson case...

238
00:19:29.189 --> 00:19:31.229
You're sure that Ha Ju Won is the prime suspect, right?

239
00:19:31.229 --> 00:19:34.130
She looks like the woman in the CCTV footage from the gas station,

240
00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:36.870
and the footprints found on the scene also match hers.

241
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:39.939
We tracked her burner phone's base station,

242
00:19:39.939 --> 00:19:41.469
and her trails match that of the suspect.

243
00:19:41.469 --> 00:19:45.040
Then let's conclude that she was the culprit in the arson case.

244
00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:48.479
We can't arraign her as she's dead, so let's just close the case.

245
00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:49.580
Got it.

246
00:19:49.709 --> 00:19:50.709
Yes, sir.

247
00:19:51.409 --> 00:19:54.780
And you guys are certain that Ha Ju Won is also...

248
00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:56.150
the real IV drip serial killer, right?

249
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:58.860
We examined every case that occurred after Myung Yi Suk's arrest,

250
00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:01.419
and all the victims were in the same ward as her.

251
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:03.130
We searched her house...

252
00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:05.090
and found vials and syringes used in the crime.

253
00:20:05.229 --> 00:20:06.929
They match the vials we collected at the scene.

254
00:20:07.429 --> 00:20:11.169
We can't indict her for this either because she's dead now.

255
00:20:11.169 --> 00:20:12.439
(Can't indict due to no right of arraignment)

256
00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:15.969
What about the manipulation of evidence?

257
00:20:17.269 --> 00:20:19.380
Ha Ju Won manipulated the evidence.

258
00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:21.280
It wasn't me.

259
00:20:23.209 --> 00:20:26.080
So are you saying that she's the one who framed his dad...

260
00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.850
for the serial murder, not you?

261
00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:29.249
If what I remember is correct,

262
00:20:30.019 --> 00:20:33.189
those vials were found in your dad's office.

263
00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.120
That office was inside the hospital,

264
00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:38.600
which means that she had access to it as his patient.

265
00:20:39.459 --> 00:20:41.630
What do you think? Doesn't it make sense?

266
00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:43.699
It does.

267
00:20:44.499 --> 00:20:46.499
It was so easy for you to come up with that plausible theory.

268
00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.140
Why was it hard for you back then?

269
00:20:49.709 --> 00:20:52.080
Why couldn't you think of it at the time?

270
00:20:56.209 --> 00:20:57.509
- He's on his knees. - He's kneeling.

271
00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:01.890
I'm sorry.

272
00:21:03.919 --> 00:21:06.489
As a prosecutor, I shouldn't have stopped suspecting her.

273
00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:08.830
I just didn't think that anyone could be...

274
00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:10.790
that methodical and meticulous.

275
00:21:11.429 --> 00:21:13.030
It's all my fault.

276
00:21:13.729 --> 00:21:16.469
Then you should take responsibility for it. You said it's your fault.

277
00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:18.499
I want to take responsibility for it,

278
00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:22.469
but making such a mistake...

279
00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:27.110
isn't considered illegal.

280
00:21:32.719 --> 00:21:33.949
- Bring my dad back to life! - Hey, Dae Gu.

281
00:21:34.019 --> 00:21:35.390
Bring my dad back to life!

282
00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:37.419
- Dae Gu, calm down. - Shouldn't we stop them?

283
00:21:38.019 --> 00:21:39.790
- Bring my dad back to life... - Gosh.

284
00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:47.830
Goodness. Ha Ju Won's death means...

285
00:21:47.999 --> 00:21:50.300
fruitless closures for a number of cases.

286
00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:53.540
Totally. It's been concluded that all of them were her doing.

287
00:21:53.669 --> 00:21:57.070
Let's just focus on the rest of the trials for the Ha Ju Won case.

288
00:22:01.009 --> 00:22:03.550
Hong Joo just regained her consciousness.

289
00:22:05.719 --> 00:22:07.419
Sir, I need to step out briefly.

290
00:22:07.479 --> 00:22:09.150
Why? What's going on?

291
00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:10.749
Hong Joo just woke up.

292
00:22:10.949 --> 00:22:13.259
My gosh, that's such a great news. Go see her now.

293
00:22:13.459 --> 00:22:15.530
- Okay, I'll be back in a bit. - Go, go on.

294
00:22:15.929 --> 00:22:18.630
What a relief. I've been really worried about her.

295
00:22:20.729 --> 00:22:23.429
Mr. Lee, how about you team up with Mr. Jung...

296
00:22:23.499 --> 00:22:25.199
and take care of the trials together?

297
00:22:25.199 --> 00:22:28.199
I heard that the CEO of the firm, Mr. Ko, will defend Lee Yu Beom.

298
00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:30.239
You won't be able to handle him alone.

299
00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:33.810
You think so?

300
00:22:34.979 --> 00:22:36.509
He's still just a lawyer.

301
00:22:36.509 --> 00:22:39.350
He's nothing special. Goodness.

302
00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:40.519
Because of him, our request...

303
00:22:40.519 --> 00:22:42.219
for the warrant against Lee Yu Beom got declined.

304
00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:45.189
He didn't even get arrested for the murder investigation.

305
00:22:45.189 --> 00:22:46.459
Isn't that impressive?

306
00:22:46.459 --> 00:22:49.130
Yes, that's obviously why he makes an eight-figure salary.

307
00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:50.130
He makes eight figures?

308
00:22:50.959 --> 00:22:53.459
My gosh. What's the daily breakdown, then?

309
00:22:53.459 --> 00:22:55.269
He makes about 27,000 dollars a day.

310
00:22:55.269 --> 00:22:57.030
Even if he only works four days a year,

311
00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:58.370
he'd still make more than you do.

312
00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:00.300
That was quick, wasn't it?

313
00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.969
It sure was. Fast enough to make me feel like swearing at you.

314
00:23:05.939 --> 00:23:09.249
I'll team up with Mr. Jung and tackle it together.

315
00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:15.620
(Intensive Care Unit)

316
00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:18.890
(Intensive Care Unit)

317
00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:22.130
(Visitors are only allowed twice a day at 11am and 7pm.)

318
00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.300
Excuse me. Please let me in for a moment.

319
00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:32.570
I just need five minutes. No, just for a minute.

320
00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:33.800
I'll just see her face and leave.

321
00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.909
I'm sorry. Please come back at the next visiting hour.

322
00:23:35.909 --> 00:23:38.640
Please. Let me just make sure that she's okay.

323
00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.140
I'm okay.

324
00:23:49.489 --> 00:23:50.550
Hong Joo.

325
00:23:57.689 --> 00:23:59.929
Are you all right? Can you move your arms and legs?

326
00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:01.870
Can you recognize me?

327
00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:03.699
Of course, I can.

328
00:24:04.429 --> 00:24:07.469
I also know that you did your very best to save my life.

329
00:24:12.509 --> 00:24:13.780
I heard everything.

330
00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:15.780
Every single thing that you said.

331
00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:29.229
I'm so relieved.

332
00:24:30.459 --> 00:24:31.689
I'm really glad that you're okay.

333
00:24:34.499 --> 00:24:35.530
Thanks.

334
00:24:36.969 --> 00:24:39.870
You got rid of my long-standing nightmares.

335
00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:57.919
Is it okay for you to walk now? Aren't you dizzy?

336
00:24:58.150 --> 00:25:00.820
No, I waited outside for you because I'm fine.

337
00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.290
I'll be moving to a general ward soon.

338
00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:06.600
How did you know that I'd be late?

339
00:25:06.959 --> 00:25:07.959
Did you have a dream again?

340
00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:10.130
I kept having dreams about you while I was sleeping.

341
00:25:10.429 --> 00:25:12.669
That's why I have a rough idea about what's going on with the case...

342
00:25:12.769 --> 00:25:16.140
and what kind of nonsense Lee Yu Beom has been spewing.

343
00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:20.380
And I also know about Mr. Choi.

344
00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:25.179
He was the police officer.

345
00:25:27.219 --> 00:25:28.219
Yes.

346
00:25:30.449 --> 00:25:31.919
I saw you crying in my dream.

347
00:25:41.659 --> 00:25:43.199
I cried with you.

(Choi Dam Dong, Hae Kwang Law Firm)

350
00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:10.489
Mr. Choi, I brought you a cup of coffee.

351
00:26:10.489 --> 00:26:12.159
My gosh, thank you.

352
00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:14.459
So? Do you like your office?

353
00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:17.400
Yes, this desk is bigger...

354
00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:19.269
than the chief prosecutor's desk.

355
00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.909
Oh, we have a gym and a sauna too.

356
00:26:21.909 --> 00:26:22.969
Feel free to use them often.

357
00:26:23.439 --> 00:26:26.340
My gosh, I should brag about it to Ms. Moon.

358
00:26:27.409 --> 00:26:30.650
Oh, right. I heard that Reporter Nam Hong Joo...

359
00:26:30.949 --> 00:26:32.650
has regained her consciousness.

360
00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:34.979
She woke up?

361
00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:38.519
What's wrong? Isn't it good news?

362
00:26:39.419 --> 00:26:40.419
Of course, it is.

363
00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:42.659
It's great news.

364
00:26:44.159 --> 00:26:45.199
I'm glad to hear that.

365
00:26:46.759 --> 00:26:48.459
It sure is great news.

366
00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:50.769
We have one more ally now.

367
00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:53.540
Hello, sir.

368
00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:55.169
- Oh, hello. - Hello.

369
00:26:56.739 --> 00:27:00.540
All I have to do at the trial is read what you wrote aloud, right?

370
00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:02.850
Where's the draft? Do you have it ready?

371
00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:03.880
Yes.

Is this it?

374
00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:16.560
Yes, sir.

375
00:27:17.459 --> 00:27:20.159
Arrange a dinner with Reporter Nam.

376
00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:21.429
She's on our side,

377
00:27:21.429 --> 00:27:23.130
so we'll have to coordinate what to say at the trial.

378
00:27:26.469 --> 00:27:29.769
Sir, there's something I need to tell you.

379
00:27:29.769 --> 00:27:32.080
What? What is it?

380
00:27:32.739 --> 00:27:35.749
Reporter Nam may not side with us.

381
00:27:35.749 --> 00:27:36.909
Why wouldn't she?

382
00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:39.850
You risked your life to save her.

383
00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:42.419
She might have gotten the wrong idea about me.

384
00:27:42.419 --> 00:27:44.550
She must've been extremely flustered when it happened, you know.

(Key Defense Arguments)

386
00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:55.600
Tell me what kind of wrong idea she might have.

387
00:27:56.469 --> 00:27:58.300
I haven't done a trial in a long time.

388
00:27:58.330 --> 00:27:59.699
I don't want to embarrass myself.

389
00:28:11.479 --> 00:28:12.620
Look, Mr. Lee.

390
00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.120
Yes, sir.

391
00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:16.949
Do you think I offered to defend you because I'm fond of you?

392
00:28:17.519 --> 00:28:19.590
Do you think I took the case to make some petty cash?

393
00:28:20.419 --> 00:28:22.959
No, I didn't think of it like that.

394
00:28:22.959 --> 00:28:25.090
I'm not interested in knowing what kind of person you are.

395
00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:26.199
I don't even believe you.

396
00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:29.929
Whether you killed her unintentionally or not...

397
00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.870
doesn't matter to me.

398
00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:34.140
I just don't like the fact...

399
00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:36.269
that my firm's name has been tainted.

400
00:28:37.469 --> 00:28:38.709
You need to tell me the truth...

401
00:28:39.179 --> 00:28:41.040
so that I can either clean it or cover it up.

402
00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:43.280
Tell me now.

403
00:28:44.509 --> 00:28:45.650
What is the misunderstanding?

404
00:28:49.719 --> 00:28:50.719
Sir.

405
00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:52.919
