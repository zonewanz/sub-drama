1
00:00:21.718 --> 00:00:23.948
Let's go.

2
00:00:24.252 --> 00:00:25.983
I'm so happy.

3
00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:27.683
I'm so happy.

4
00:00:28.083 --> 00:00:29.954
I'm really happy.

5
00:00:32.254 --> 00:00:33.394
Look out!

6
00:00:38.634 --> 00:00:40.664
- Are you all right? - Yes.

7
00:00:44.173 --> 00:00:45.474
What?

8
00:00:46.673 --> 00:00:47.703
What's wrong?

9
00:00:48.944 --> 00:00:50.914
- Why is it not working? - What's going on?

10
00:00:50.914 --> 00:00:52.173
The brake isn't working.

11
00:00:54.144 --> 00:00:56.584
- What do we do? - Let's jump on the count of three.

12
00:00:56.584 --> 00:00:57.584
What?

13
00:00:57.584 --> 00:01:00.354
It's going to be okay. In 1, 2, 3!

14
00:01:25.173 --> 00:01:26.384
Who are you?

15
00:01:27.543 --> 00:01:30.683
You are the serial killer, right?

16
00:01:31.953 --> 00:01:32.953
Yoo Eun Ho.

17
00:01:33.953 --> 00:01:34.953
Yoo Eun Ho!

18
00:01:35.884 --> 00:01:37.423
Wake up.

19
00:01:38.694 --> 00:01:39.763
Yoo Eun Ho.

20
00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:45.363
Are you awake?

21
00:01:45.594 --> 00:01:48.164
Yes. That was so close.

22
00:01:48.534 --> 00:01:50.034
I could almost see the face.

23
00:01:51.934 --> 00:01:53.004
What are you saying?

24
00:01:54.073 --> 00:01:55.543
Get up.

25
00:01:56.743 --> 00:01:57.814
Get up.

26
00:01:58.513 --> 00:01:59.673
Are you all right?

27
00:01:59.673 --> 00:02:02.184
Yes, I'm all right. Are you?

28
00:02:02.414 --> 00:02:03.983
I'm fine, but...

29
00:02:15.624 --> 00:02:16.694
I'm ruined.

30
00:02:17.893 --> 00:02:19.034
What should we do?

31
00:02:20.534 --> 00:02:21.564
Yes.

32
00:02:21.863 --> 00:02:23.573
We're 40 minutes away from that place.

33
00:02:24.434 --> 00:02:25.634
Please be quick.

34
00:02:30.613 --> 00:02:31.643
Ye Ri.

35
00:03:19.053 --> 00:03:20.564
- Yoo Eun Ho. - Yes?

36
00:03:20.823 --> 00:03:23.263
What? What is it? What's wrong?

37
00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:29.064
It's great here.

38
00:03:30.604 --> 00:03:31.803
The view is really pretty.

39
00:03:48.524 --> 00:03:49.824
What did you wish for?

40
00:03:53.094 --> 00:03:54.164
It's a secret.

41
00:03:54.524 --> 00:03:56.324
If I tell you, it won't become true.

42
00:03:58.264 --> 00:03:59.664
I have a secret too.

43
00:04:00.534 --> 00:04:01.563
What is it?

44
00:04:02.503 --> 00:04:05.673
I can read people's minds.

45
00:04:07.204 --> 00:04:09.104
I got in an accident three years ago,

46
00:04:09.274 --> 00:04:11.144
and after that, I gained a special ability.

47
00:04:13.014 --> 00:04:14.243
All right.

48
00:04:14.483 --> 00:04:16.483
It's true. Why don't you believe me?

49
00:04:16.813 --> 00:04:18.613
I do. I believe you.

50
00:04:21.483 --> 00:04:22.854
I can see your mind right now.

51
00:04:23.623 --> 00:04:25.493
I know about the person that you still love.

52
00:04:26.563 --> 00:04:27.563
What?

53
00:04:41.173 --> 00:04:42.173
(Death Certificate)

54
00:04:42.173 --> 00:04:43.613
His ex-girlfriend used to live here.

55
00:04:44.514 --> 00:04:46.074
She lived in Room 301.

56
00:04:46.074 --> 00:04:47.483
- Room 301? - Yes.

57
00:04:48.483 --> 00:04:50.753
That day,

58
00:04:51.313 --> 00:04:53.354
just before I got mugged,

59
00:04:54.854 --> 00:04:57.324
I saw the man that lived in Room 302.

60
00:04:57.923 --> 00:05:01.894
Maybe the person that hit me is the serial killer.

61
00:05:14.574 --> 00:05:17.813
The second murder happened at Room 302, Chereville Apartment.

62
00:05:18.373 --> 00:05:21.113
On that day, Eun Ho had an incident just over here.

63
00:05:21.313 --> 00:05:25.613
The distance and the time frame suggest that Eun Ho could be right.

64
00:05:26.483 --> 00:05:30.324
Could it be that the mugger and the serial killer are the same person?

65
00:05:34.094 --> 00:05:36.394
If that's true, where would he be?

66
00:05:37.664 --> 00:05:40.164
Who do you think is the person I love?

67
00:05:41.534 --> 00:05:42.563
It's...

68
00:05:48.104 --> 00:05:50.043
It's me, of course.

69
00:05:51.144 --> 00:05:52.974
You know me.

70
00:05:52.974 --> 00:05:55.043
I'm a person that you can fall in love with easily...

71
00:05:55.043 --> 00:05:57.813
but someone that won't be easy to escape from.

72
00:05:57.914 --> 00:05:59.854
Yes, I get it.

73
00:05:59.854 --> 00:06:02.154
Of course.

74
00:06:03.224 --> 00:06:04.654
You're so silly.

75
00:06:05.193 --> 00:06:07.464
By the way, what were you going to tell me?

76
00:06:07.594 --> 00:06:09.493
- You wanted to tell me something. - What?

77
00:06:11.534 --> 00:06:13.303
Well, that is...

78
00:06:18.233 --> 00:06:23.844
Millions and millions of flowers blossom

79
00:06:25.113 --> 00:06:28.214
- This is so romantic. - Here.

80
00:06:30.854 --> 00:06:33.053
- Cheers. - Cheers.

81
00:06:39.824 --> 00:06:41.524
That's good. C'est bien.

82
00:06:44.894 --> 00:06:46.063
This is great.

83
00:06:48.964 --> 00:06:51.003
The sky in Seoul feels so stuffy.

84
00:06:51.233 --> 00:06:52.733
Saipan, on the other hand,

85
00:06:55.043 --> 00:06:57.844
has so many stars that it's nearly scary.

86
00:06:58.214 --> 00:06:59.344
I miss Saipan.

87
00:07:00.243 --> 00:07:02.883
It seems like you've been to so many places.

88
00:07:03.654 --> 00:07:06.313
We only live once. We should do everything we want.

89
00:07:07.053 --> 00:07:11.053
How about you? Where did you like best?

90
00:07:12.154 --> 00:07:13.193
I...

91
00:07:13.863 --> 00:07:16.594
have only been abroad to attend conferences.

92
00:07:17.063 --> 00:07:20.063
In my 20s, I was busy earning my diplomas,

93
00:07:20.863 --> 00:07:22.433
and I didn't have time to travel.

94
00:07:24.633 --> 00:07:26.173
I see.

95
00:07:28.803 --> 00:07:30.943
Millions of flowers

96
00:07:35.313 --> 00:07:38.584
You became a professor at such a young age because you worked hard.

97
00:07:39.613 --> 00:07:42.024
And that's how we met.

98
00:07:42.183 --> 00:07:43.454
Of course.

99
00:07:55.363 --> 00:07:57.633
Let's go inside.

100
00:07:59.804 --> 00:08:00.903
Who is it?

101
00:08:01.503 --> 00:08:03.174
- Who is it? - Who is it?

102
00:08:05.974 --> 00:08:08.883
It's delicious.

103
00:08:15.054 --> 00:08:17.824
Vincent is from Netherlands.

104
00:08:17.924 --> 00:08:19.964
I met him during my trip to Mongolia.

105
00:08:20.064 --> 00:08:23.233
I heard he was staying near here, so I invited him. Is that all right?

106
00:08:25.163 --> 00:08:26.194
It's fine.

107
00:08:26.934 --> 00:08:28.003
Vincent?

108
00:08:28.964 --> 00:08:30.003
Do you draw?

109
00:08:30.503 --> 00:08:32.304
Gosh, you've got to be kidding me.

110
00:08:32.704 --> 00:08:36.844
How did you meet a Dutchman in Mongolia?

111
00:08:37.044 --> 00:08:38.613
Do you even understand each other?

112
00:08:39.613 --> 00:08:42.883
Talking isn't the only way to communicate.

113
00:08:43.283 --> 00:08:44.454
Right, Vincent?

114
00:08:46.354 --> 00:08:47.383
What?

115
00:08:48.383 --> 00:08:51.954
Kyung Ae is an excellent cook.

116
00:08:52.424 --> 00:08:53.493
It's great.

117
00:08:53.763 --> 00:08:55.964
What? She cooked for you?

118
00:08:56.263 --> 00:08:58.393
You had it too? You did?

119
00:08:59.434 --> 00:09:00.834
Gosh.

120
00:09:01.033 --> 00:09:03.604
Fate brought us together.

121
00:09:03.804 --> 00:09:05.873
Let's drink to it. Cheers.

122
00:09:05.873 --> 00:09:07.273
All right. Let's do it.

123
00:09:07.474 --> 00:09:09.503
- Cheers. - Gosh.

124
00:09:10.944 --> 00:09:12.773
Gosh.

125
00:09:13.214 --> 00:09:15.084
Is it good?

126
00:09:17.113 --> 00:09:18.684
- Perfect. - Perfect?

127
00:09:18.684 --> 00:09:20.424
You must be joking.

128
00:09:20.523 --> 00:09:23.023
- It's great. - Is it?

129
00:09:23.294 --> 00:09:25.054
There's no more wine.

130
00:09:25.153 --> 00:09:27.663
I'm sorry Vincent, but can you get us some more wine?

131
00:09:27.663 --> 00:09:29.224
- More wine? - Yes.

132
00:09:29.224 --> 00:09:30.263
Okay.

133
00:09:31.834 --> 00:09:32.993
Gosh.

134
00:10:01.623 --> 00:10:04.163
- Did you just come home? - Yes.

135
00:10:04.163 --> 00:10:07.104
But you went out yesterday. It's morning right now.

136
00:10:07.604 --> 00:10:08.903
That means you stayed out overnight.

137
00:10:10.873 --> 00:10:12.733
Gosh, I'm so tired.

138
00:10:18.544 --> 00:10:20.413
He smells of a strange woman.

139
00:10:24.054 --> 00:10:25.054
Wait.

140
00:10:26.824 --> 00:10:29.184
Eun Ho, were you with a woman overnight?

141
00:10:39.834 --> 00:10:41.604
Why are there grasses on his back?

142
00:10:42.834 --> 00:10:44.133
What did he do on the grass?

143
00:10:53.044 --> 00:10:54.944
"He's gone."

144
00:10:56.184 --> 00:10:59.783
"My love was taken by another scum."

145
00:11:00.324 --> 00:11:03.893
"The green mountains turn red and..."

146
00:11:04.924 --> 00:11:05.954
What was the next lyrics again?

147
00:11:07.123 --> 00:11:12.163
Anyway. That's why I totally lost my mind.

148
00:11:26.013 --> 00:11:27.814
Gosh, what's this?

149
00:11:42.123 --> 00:11:44.434
I'm sorry. It probably will get stained.

150
00:11:44.533 --> 00:11:48.663
It's my heart that got stained, not my clothes.

151
00:11:48.763 --> 00:11:49.804
What?

152
00:11:49.804 --> 00:11:54.003
No, I meant that it'll be fine. It'll come out when I wash it.

153
00:11:55.974 --> 00:11:57.413
I'll pay you for laundry.

154
00:11:58.344 --> 00:12:00.344
- I don't have any cash. - It's fine.

155
00:12:00.983 --> 00:12:03.013
I know we've just met,

156
00:12:03.013 --> 00:12:05.153
but you don't need to pay me anything.

157
00:12:05.153 --> 00:12:06.314
At least, you should have this.

158
00:12:06.854 --> 00:12:08.023
(Book Store)

159
00:12:09.283 --> 00:12:10.324
It's right over there.

160
00:12:13.424 --> 00:12:15.123
You look like a student. If you visit next time,

161
00:12:15.123 --> 00:12:17.294
I'll give you a book as a present instead of the laundry fee.

162
00:12:18.794 --> 00:12:21.863
Of course, I'll be there. I will.

163
00:12:30.344 --> 00:12:31.643
(Book Store)

164
00:12:33.184 --> 00:12:34.184
Yes!

165
00:13:04.474 --> 00:13:06.143
- Ye Ri? - Yes?

166
00:13:06.483 --> 00:13:08.214
Did everything go alright in Jeongdongjin?

167
00:13:08.314 --> 00:13:10.954
Yes, I delivered everything you told me to.

168
00:13:10.954 --> 00:13:12.214
Okay.

169
00:13:13.483 --> 00:13:14.724
- Eun Ho? - Yes?

170
00:13:14.724 --> 00:13:17.324
I saw sands on the bathroom floor next to the bathtub.

171
00:13:17.854 --> 00:13:20.594
- I think they're from Jeongdongjin. - They must be from the playground.

172
00:13:21.424 --> 00:13:23.064
Min Jung had a sports day couple days ago.

173
00:13:31.633 --> 00:13:35.074
It's strange. Very strange.

174
00:13:39.143 --> 00:13:40.783
It's strange.

175
00:13:42.013 --> 00:13:43.383
You guys went to Jeongdongjin, right?

176
00:13:46.883 --> 00:13:48.383
Maybe not.

177
00:13:54.523 --> 00:13:56.263
- It's so strange. - Ye Ri.

178
00:13:56.263 --> 00:13:58.794
- It's so strange. - Han Ye Ri.

179
00:13:58.794 --> 00:14:03.074
Something must have happened between the two.

180
00:14:03.403 --> 00:14:04.834
- Han Ye Ri. - These two...

181
00:14:04.934 --> 00:14:06.704
I told you to stop.

182
00:14:07.003 --> 00:14:08.544
Do you want to go watch a movie on Friday?

183
00:14:09.304 --> 00:14:10.613
Yes, all right.

184
00:14:12.474 --> 00:14:14.444
You want to keep it a secret? Why?

185
00:14:15.913 --> 00:14:18.814
It'll be embarrassing to see the professor.

186
00:14:20.224 --> 00:14:22.153
I just started working.

187
00:14:24.253 --> 00:14:27.393
And you're really popular at the school.

188
00:14:28.163 --> 00:14:31.993
You're the man who's going out with the nation's idol.

189
00:14:32.094 --> 00:14:35.363
I explained that to you. She's just a friend.

190
00:14:35.464 --> 00:14:38.873
It doesn't matter. I don't want others...

191
00:14:39.674 --> 00:14:41.273
to know about our relationship.

192
00:14:42.704 --> 00:14:44.944
All right. Let's keep it a secret.

193
00:14:54.153 --> 00:14:56.694
I couldn't tell him.

194
00:14:57.893 --> 00:15:01.163
How can I tell him that I'm crazy with my own mouth?

195
00:15:02.263 --> 00:15:03.334
Ye Ri!

196
00:15:04.064 --> 00:15:05.964
Yes! Hello!

197
00:15:09.733 --> 00:15:11.334
- Ye Ri. - Yes?

198
00:15:12.033 --> 00:15:15.773
It feels so good to be with you like this.

199
00:15:16.273 --> 00:15:17.413
It does.

200
00:15:19.013 --> 00:15:21.314
- What are you doing? - Nothing.

201
00:15:21.743 --> 00:15:24.483
Look at the sky. It's so clear.

202
00:15:24.483 --> 00:15:26.454
The weather is so nice.

203
00:15:28.424 --> 00:15:31.224
It really feels like I'm dating you.

204
00:15:40.934 --> 00:15:42.434
Do you have anything you want to do with me?

205
00:15:42.533 --> 00:15:44.104
- Something I want to do with you? - Yes.

206
00:15:45.233 --> 00:15:47.373
Something you really want to do with me.

207
00:15:52.074 --> 00:15:56.783
I want to do the most normal and unimportant things with you.

208
00:15:58.513 --> 00:16:01.483
I want to walk with you slowly in Gangnam...

209
00:16:01.684 --> 00:16:04.123
where everyone is in a hurry.

210
00:16:04.123 --> 00:16:05.224
It tastes nice.

211
00:16:05.753 --> 00:16:06.924
It feels great.

212
00:16:10.893 --> 00:16:13.064
Gosh, why is he late?

213
00:16:19.174 --> 00:16:20.174
Ye Ri.

214
00:16:21.804 --> 00:16:23.174
Ye Ri. I'm sorry.

215
00:16:23.174 --> 00:16:24.373
What are you apologizing for?

216
00:16:24.373 --> 00:16:26.613
- I'm sorry, Ye Ri. - I'm not going to watch the movie.

217
00:16:26.613 --> 00:16:29.983
- It started a long time ago. - I want to wait for a long time.

218
00:16:31.514 --> 00:16:35.024
And I'd pretend to be angry while you try to apologize.

219
00:16:37.824 --> 00:16:39.094
I like this so much.

220
00:16:39.193 --> 00:16:40.264
Give me your hand.

221
00:16:40.564 --> 00:16:41.594
- Try. - Gosh.

222
00:16:42.494 --> 00:16:44.693
I want to ride bicycles with you in Han River.

223
00:16:44.693 --> 00:16:45.834
- Are you all right? - Yes.

224
00:16:46.433 --> 00:16:48.903
And then, we'd lie down on the grass...

225
00:16:49.004 --> 00:16:51.804
and play games spending time together.

226
00:16:52.173 --> 00:16:54.074
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

227
00:16:54.873 --> 00:16:57.514
- Gosh, what should I do? - What should we do?

228
00:17:01.683 --> 00:17:03.554
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

229
00:17:04.484 --> 00:17:05.554
Wait.

230
00:17:08.223 --> 00:17:09.754
- It hurts. - It's bleeding.

231
00:17:10.354 --> 00:17:13.594
By the way, I haven't been to Dream World yet.

232
00:17:14.393 --> 00:17:18.433
I want to go to Dream World and ride the most boring rides.

233
00:17:20.903 --> 00:17:24.234
I want to go on normal dates that everyone else does.

234
00:17:29.473 --> 00:17:32.074
I'll do every one of these for you.

235
00:17:33.244 --> 00:17:34.244
What do you mean?

236
00:17:34.814 --> 00:17:35.883
You don't have to know.

237
00:17:44.393 --> 00:17:47.294
You're bleeding. Your nose is bleeding.

238
00:17:47.393 --> 00:17:48.794
Gosh, blood.

239
00:17:49.024 --> 00:17:50.794
Are you all right?

240
00:17:52.564 --> 00:17:53.834
- Are you feeling dizzy? - No.

241
00:17:54.734 --> 00:17:56.574
It's fine. This happens often.

242
00:17:56.774 --> 00:17:58.104
- I'll be fine. - Gosh.

243
00:17:59.203 --> 00:18:01.044
I think you need to see a doctor.

244
00:18:01.203 --> 00:18:02.203
It's fine.

245
00:18:02.673 --> 00:18:05.544
I must have been working too hard. My body must have been tired.

246
00:18:05.973 --> 00:18:07.113
But I'm still worried.

247
00:18:07.113 --> 00:18:09.344
You don't have to worry about it. Let's go.

248
00:18:09.344 --> 00:18:10.354
Gosh.

249
00:18:13.584 --> 00:18:14.754
If you look over here,

250
00:18:15.254 --> 00:18:16.453
the brake lights,

251
00:18:16.994 --> 00:18:19.693
cowling, and signal levers...

252
00:18:19.794 --> 00:18:22.163
have all been changed.

253
00:18:22.824 --> 00:18:24.633
Did you say that the brake didn't work all of a sudden?

254
00:18:24.734 --> 00:18:26.463
Yes, it was fine, but suddenly...

255
00:18:27.163 --> 00:18:29.264
I didn't want to lend it to you. You took it away from me.

256
00:18:29.463 --> 00:18:31.403
It wasn't his fault.

257
00:18:31.604 --> 00:18:33.643
It was fine before it suddenly stopped working.

258
00:18:35.574 --> 00:18:37.943
I heard that when we changed the tires last time,

259
00:18:37.943 --> 00:18:40.883
you fixed all the other parts. But what happened?

260
00:18:41.413 --> 00:18:43.284
Did you fix them all right?

261
00:18:43.383 --> 00:18:45.854
Of course we did. Of course.

262
00:18:46.723 --> 00:18:49.254
Obviously, someone else did this on purpose.

263
00:18:49.453 --> 00:18:52.354
All right. Let's check again.

264
00:18:52.453 --> 00:18:53.623
Follow me.

265
00:18:54.064 --> 00:18:55.094
Here.

266
00:18:56.324 --> 00:19:00.734
Look over here. There's supposed to be a nut here, but there isn't.

267
00:19:00.933 --> 00:19:02.804
And do you see the scratch marks?

268
00:19:03.274 --> 00:19:07.604
This means that this person used a spanner to take out...

269
00:19:08.344 --> 00:19:09.774
this nut like this.

270
00:19:10.673 --> 00:19:12.873
That person must have taken it out.

271
00:19:13.613 --> 00:19:14.943
So the important fact here is...

272
00:19:15.383 --> 00:19:19.383
that someone pulled out the nut on purpose.

273
00:19:19.984 --> 00:19:22.254
Do you understand? Wait a moment.

274
00:19:22.984 --> 00:19:24.453
Hey!

275
00:19:24.653 --> 00:19:28.123
Aren't you just making that up so that you won't have to pay for it?

276
00:19:43.673 --> 00:19:45.014
But who would have done this?

277
00:19:45.913 --> 00:19:48.584
Who would have done this and why?

278
00:19:50.984 --> 00:19:53.223
Someone broke this on purpose?

279
00:19:56.723 --> 00:20:00.423
It's highly unlikely that it happened.

280
00:20:03.963 --> 00:20:05.633
The culprit in this incident...

281
00:20:05.963 --> 00:20:09.163
commits a crime only after careful planning.

282
00:20:09.703 --> 00:20:13.244
When Eun Ho was mugged, it was accidental.

283
00:20:13.244 --> 00:20:17.314
If the culprits are indeed same, he wouldn't have left him there.

284
00:20:17.413 --> 00:20:19.274
He would have finished him.

285
00:20:19.373 --> 00:20:23.883
So it means that it's highly unlikely that the culprit...

286
00:20:23.913 --> 00:20:25.054
and the mugger are the same people.

287
00:20:25.054 --> 00:20:26.113
(Highly unlikely)

288
00:20:26.113 --> 00:20:27.153
I thought so too.

289
00:20:27.153 --> 00:20:30.623
That was my thought as an expert profiler.

290
00:20:31.324 --> 00:20:33.863
I'll tell you my opinion as a psychology professor.

291
00:20:35.393 --> 00:20:38.433
I think that it's highly possible.

292
00:20:39.334 --> 00:20:40.334
What?

293
00:20:40.963 --> 00:20:44.504
You're being ambiguous. You're confusing me.

294
00:20:44.703 --> 00:20:46.133
Was that confusing?

295
00:20:46.133 --> 00:20:50.413
I can't understand the culprit's mind completely.

296
00:20:50.413 --> 00:20:52.514
People who work in this field...

297
00:20:52.514 --> 00:20:56.484
always tend to be ambiguous because there are always exceptions.

298
00:20:59.183 --> 00:21:03.423
So you're trying to say that you can't be sure of either.

299
00:21:05.623 --> 00:21:09.264
So the only way for this to end is for Eun Ho to remember his face.

300
00:21:12.294 --> 00:21:14.104
Thank you for your time.

301
00:21:14.203 --> 00:21:15.264
It seems like...

302
00:21:16.234 --> 00:21:18.473
you're very attached to this case.

303
00:21:19.074 --> 00:21:22.304
I heard that the police station is giving up on this case.

304
00:21:23.713 --> 00:21:24.713
(Bath Murder of Kim Yoon Hee)

305
00:21:25.713 --> 00:21:27.544
On March 14, 2014,

306
00:21:28.344 --> 00:21:29.544
the first victim,

307
00:21:30.683 --> 00:21:33.153
21-year-old Kim Yoon Hee was murdered.

308
00:21:34.223 --> 00:21:35.484
She was my sister.

309
00:21:42.893 --> 00:21:44.633
(Serial Bath Murder of Kim Yoon Hee)

310
00:21:47.363 --> 00:21:48.433
Professor.

311
00:21:50.304 --> 00:21:52.433
Why do you think the culprit stopped committing murders?

312
00:22:03.484 --> 00:22:06.314
It's been a while since I've used my skills.

313
00:22:06.824 --> 00:22:07.854
Your skills?

314
00:22:08.824 --> 00:22:09.854
Yes, you'll see.

315
00:22:10.854 --> 00:22:11.854
Why so suddenly?

316
00:22:13.024 --> 00:22:14.393
- Come here. - What?

317
00:22:14.723 --> 00:22:17.463
I can finally show you something.

318
00:22:17.463 --> 00:22:19.163
- Look. - All right.

319
00:22:19.163 --> 00:22:20.433
- I'm going to start. - All right.

320
00:22:23.004 --> 00:22:24.104
I want the one with the heart.

321
00:22:24.104 --> 00:22:25.133
- The heart? - Yes.

322
00:22:29.344 --> 00:22:30.744
- Oh, my. - See?

323
00:22:30.744 --> 00:22:32.443
- You did it. - I did.

324
00:22:32.713 --> 00:22:33.913
See?

325
00:22:34.544 --> 00:22:36.143
Gosh, you're so good.

326
00:22:36.143 --> 00:22:37.984
- Let's do another one. - Another one?

327
00:22:38.213 --> 00:22:39.683
That one. The same one.

328
00:22:39.683 --> 00:22:41.683
- The same one? - Yes.

329
00:22:43.693 --> 00:22:44.923
- Okay. - Gosh.

330
00:22:44.923 --> 00:22:47.324
- I got two at once. - We got two.

331
00:22:47.324 --> 00:22:48.564
Gosh.

332
00:22:49.294 --> 00:22:50.594
- Oh, my. - I nearly have it.

333
00:22:50.594 --> 00:22:53.234
- I nearly have it. - It's nearly there.

334
00:22:57.133 --> 00:22:58.133
I got it.

335
00:22:58.433 --> 00:22:59.744
- I got it. - Gosh.

336
00:22:59.744 --> 00:23:01.703
- If I pull it up like this... - Just like that?

337
00:23:06.683 --> 00:23:08.943
- I got it. - You got it!

338
00:23:10.584 --> 00:23:11.883
Oh, my.

339
00:23:13.953 --> 00:23:15.153
You know what?

340
00:23:15.153 --> 00:23:18.994
During the shooting training, I shot 20 out of 20 and got a day off.

341
00:23:19.094 --> 00:23:20.463
You're really good at it.

342
00:23:20.564 --> 00:23:23.163
When I catch something, I don't let it go...

343
00:23:23.363 --> 00:23:25.034
whether it's a doll or a person.

344
00:23:25.363 --> 00:23:27.203
Especially you, Han Ye Ri.

345
00:23:30.074 --> 00:23:31.133
Stop it.

346
00:23:31.604 --> 00:23:33.074
Gosh.

347
00:23:34.544 --> 00:23:38.143
You've given me so many things, but I don't have anything to give.

348
00:23:38.143 --> 00:23:40.383
It's fine. It's nothing.

349
00:23:43.314 --> 00:23:44.413
Let's say this is my present.

350
00:23:54.344 --> 00:23:57.943
You've given me so many things, but I don't have anything to give.

351
00:23:57.943 --> 00:24:00.183
It's fine. It's nothing.

352
00:24:03.114 --> 00:24:04.213
Let's say this is my present.

353
00:24:34.344 --> 00:24:36.314
We're already here.

354
00:24:38.114 --> 00:24:39.183
Yes.

355
00:24:51.693 --> 00:24:53.203
- I'll get going. - What?

356
00:24:54.534 --> 00:24:56.404
Yes, you should.

357
00:24:57.604 --> 00:24:59.334
Do you really want me to go?

358
00:24:59.544 --> 00:25:01.943
What? Yes.

359
00:25:02.844 --> 00:25:04.013
Go home safely.

360
00:25:04.713 --> 00:25:06.584
I'll go home after I see you go inside.

361
00:25:06.784 --> 00:25:09.443
It's fine. I'll go inside after I see you leave.

362
00:25:09.654 --> 00:25:10.713
Go on.

363
00:25:11.413 --> 00:25:13.054
What if someone tries to abduct you?

364
00:25:14.154 --> 00:25:15.223
You're too pretty.

365
00:25:21.564 --> 00:25:24.364
This is going to last all night. You should go.

366
00:25:24.364 --> 00:25:26.534
All right. I'll go.

367
00:25:29.433 --> 00:25:30.433
Wait.

368
00:25:32.844 --> 00:25:33.874
What is it?

369
00:25:41.044 --> 00:25:43.013
I want to remember this pretty face...

370
00:25:43.854 --> 00:25:45.413
so that I can think about you all night.

371
00:25:48.753 --> 00:25:52.423
I want the time to stop like this.

372
00:25:53.693 --> 00:25:54.763
I think so too.

373
00:25:56.263 --> 00:25:57.834
I want the time to stop...

374
00:25:59.463 --> 00:26:01.304
so that I can stare at you forever.

375
00:26:04.203 --> 00:26:05.233
It's nothing.

376
00:26:06.404 --> 00:26:08.703
You should go. I'll get going too.

377
00:26:09.973 --> 00:26:11.913
All right. Bye.

378
00:26:20.284 --> 00:26:21.354
Yes.

379
00:26:21.354 --> 00:26:23.324
Why are you still there?

380
00:26:24.094 --> 00:26:25.794
I'm going. Go on.

381
00:26:25.794 --> 00:26:27.523
I'll text you after I take a shower.

382
00:26:27.523 --> 00:26:29.594
- Bye. - Bye.

383
00:26:35.933 --> 00:26:37.003
Yes!

384
00:26:58.394 --> 00:26:59.453
Are you out of your mind?

385
00:27:04.294 --> 00:27:05.733
What are you doing in my house?

386
00:27:06.963 --> 00:27:10.733
I saw everything. I saw you cuddling outside.

387
00:27:12.374 --> 00:27:13.943
It just happened.

388
00:27:14.844 --> 00:27:18.074
Don't worry. We're not going to tell anyone.

389
00:27:18.413 --> 00:27:20.344
Do you think people won't figure it out?

390
00:27:20.683 --> 00:27:22.213
I already figured it out.

391
00:27:22.413 --> 00:27:24.084
Then what do you want me to do?

392
00:27:24.453 --> 00:27:28.154
I understand that it's wrong,

393
00:27:29.223 --> 00:27:32.594
but I can't control my heart.

394
00:27:45.703 --> 00:27:47.473
You're really into Yoo Eun Ho.

395
00:27:49.074 --> 00:27:50.243
But what if she comes out?

396
00:27:50.943 --> 00:27:53.384
Yoo Eun Ho can get hurt because of her as well.

397
00:27:53.884 --> 00:27:55.284
I'll take care of it.

398
00:27:55.584 --> 00:27:59.284
Please just pretend like you don't know anything.

399
00:28:00.624 --> 00:28:01.784
Please.

400
00:28:02.854 --> 00:28:03.894
I don't know.

401
00:28:04.654 --> 00:28:05.854
You do know.

402
00:28:07.193 --> 00:28:08.223
A peck on the lips.

403
00:28:11.763 --> 00:28:12.763
A kiss.

404
00:28:29.344 --> 00:28:30.513
I can't calm down.

405
00:28:31.114 --> 00:28:32.453
Did we have relaxing pills at home?

406
00:28:36.923 --> 00:28:37.953
Yoo Eun Ho.

407
00:28:46.864 --> 00:28:48.034
Eun Ho.

408
00:28:52.574 --> 00:28:53.604
Hello.

409
00:28:59.273 --> 00:29:00.584
I'm here.

410
00:29:12.753 --> 00:29:13.824
This is a dream.

411
00:29:14.663 --> 00:29:15.693
This is reality.

412
00:29:21.263 --> 00:29:23.604
Eun Ho. Yoo Eun Ho.

413
00:29:23.973 --> 00:29:25.273
I'm here.

414
00:29:25.273 --> 00:29:27.173
Eun Ho. Yoo Eun Ho.

415
00:29:36.884 --> 00:29:38.154
Gosh.

416
00:29:50.493 --> 00:29:51.993
Eun Ho, are you sleeping?

417
00:30:00.017 --> 00:30:03.249
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E04 Meloholic "Got to Be Careful"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

418
00:30:11.784 --> 00:30:12.814
I've decided...

419
00:30:13.423 --> 00:30:15.124
to stop being in love with you.

420
00:30:15.824 --> 00:30:18.394
Thank you. Can I go inside now?

421
00:30:19.493 --> 00:30:21.523
I wasn't just joking around.

422
00:30:23.864 --> 00:30:25.493
I was really in love.

423
00:30:25.993 --> 00:30:29.433
But to you, I'm just a younger sister.

424
00:30:30.404 --> 00:30:32.733
Am I really not attractive as a woman?

425
00:30:37.874 --> 00:30:38.943
Min Jung.

426
00:30:39.943 --> 00:30:43.354
If you were to cry because of another man,

427
00:30:43.683 --> 00:30:45.884
I'd strangle him...

428
00:30:46.624 --> 00:30:47.923
and beat him.

429
00:30:48.453 --> 00:30:51.124
And if you were to get married,

430
00:30:51.693 --> 00:30:53.594
I'll look into his background secretly.

431
00:30:54.564 --> 00:30:57.233
I'd check if he is competent, if his personality is all right,

432
00:30:57.233 --> 00:30:58.564
and what his parents are like.

433
00:31:00.003 --> 00:31:01.904
That's how I feel about you.

434
00:31:02.233 --> 00:31:05.534
You're more important to me as my sister.

435
00:31:08.304 --> 00:31:12.614
Even if I get married, you'll always be my first love.

436
00:31:16.314 --> 00:31:17.953
But don't check his background.

437
00:31:18.554 --> 00:31:20.554
We're not that serious yet.

438
00:31:22.854 --> 00:31:24.923
I'm in love with someone.

439
00:31:42.243 --> 00:31:44.574
I didn't know the store was closed.

440
00:31:45.114 --> 00:31:47.683
010 402 5147.

441
00:31:47.784 --> 00:31:50.683
Add my number. From Min Jung.

442
00:32:28.084 --> 00:32:29.384
Obviously,

443
00:32:30.394 --> 00:32:31.824
someone did this on purpose.

444
00:32:31.923 --> 00:32:33.993
Someone had pulled out the nut...

445
00:32:34.993 --> 00:32:36.864
on purpose.

446
00:32:39.663 --> 00:32:41.034
That's really weird.

447
00:32:52.213 --> 00:32:53.513
What is it? Tell me.

448
00:32:55.943 --> 00:32:57.354
This is my friend.

449
00:32:57.854 --> 00:33:00.324
They've been seeing each other for a while. Maybe they're dating.

450
00:33:02.654 --> 00:33:06.023
That scum. How can he date my ex-girlfriend?

451
00:33:07.923 --> 00:33:09.693
Is this what all girls are like?

452
00:33:09.794 --> 00:33:11.733
Do they forget easily and meet new boys easily?

453
00:33:15.904 --> 00:33:16.904
Eun Ho.

454
00:33:17.334 --> 00:33:19.173
Help me date her again.

455
00:33:19.673 --> 00:33:23.314
You helped Byung Cheol when he made a big fuss on the roof.

456
00:33:23.513 --> 00:33:26.344
No thanks. I'm not going to intervene in...

457
00:33:28.443 --> 00:33:29.983
Gosh, it's blood!

458
00:33:30.413 --> 00:33:31.683
Blood! Blood!

459
00:33:33.683 --> 00:33:35.753
This is a terror attack. This is a terror!

460
00:33:35.753 --> 00:33:38.824
What's this?

461
00:33:38.824 --> 00:33:40.463
What's this? Do you have tissue?

462
00:33:40.463 --> 00:33:43.094
You're bleeding.

463
00:33:43.294 --> 00:33:45.763
What should I do? You're bleeding.

464
00:33:48.804 --> 00:33:51.233
- It's blood. - Do you have a tissue?

465
00:33:51.233 --> 00:33:53.003
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

466
00:33:53.003 --> 00:33:55.244
- What happened? - What's this?

467
00:33:55.244 --> 00:33:56.514
Did you do this to him?

468
00:33:56.514 --> 00:33:57.943
- Why are you... - What are you doing?

469
00:33:58.344 --> 00:33:59.943
It wasn't me. Why are you blaming me?

470
00:33:59.943 --> 00:34:01.713
- Eun Ho, gosh. - Gosh.

471
00:34:01.713 --> 00:34:04.654
Can you call the hospital?

472
00:34:04.654 --> 00:34:06.284
Why did this happen?

473
00:34:06.284 --> 00:34:09.054
- Are you all right? - Eun Ho, are you all right?

474
00:34:09.154 --> 00:34:11.054
- Tissue. - Eun Ho.

475
00:34:11.054 --> 00:34:12.454
Get some band aids.

476
00:34:12.454 --> 00:34:14.563
- Get some band aids. - Gosh.

477
00:34:14.563 --> 00:34:18.063
- Eun Ho. Oh, my. - Gosh.

478
00:34:18.063 --> 00:34:21.603
When someone dates her, strange things happen and they get hurt.

479
00:34:21.704 --> 00:34:23.373
Get a band aid.

480
00:34:23.373 --> 00:34:25.404
- Pronounce it properly. - Gosh.

481
00:34:29.304 --> 00:34:30.744
Why did I have to hurt my right hand?

482
00:34:31.873 --> 00:34:34.284
Yes, that looks uncomfortable.

483
00:34:34.713 --> 00:34:37.753
You can't write or eat with your right hand.

484
00:34:39.083 --> 00:34:40.353
You can feed me.

485
00:34:44.753 --> 00:34:46.664
Who would have done this?

486
00:34:55.204 --> 00:34:56.474
It's not a deep cut.

487
00:34:56.574 --> 00:34:59.233
It's going to heal soon. Don't worry.

488
00:35:00.643 --> 00:35:03.744
- I'm sorry. - Why are you apologizing?

489
00:35:04.244 --> 00:35:05.844
I'm sorry for ignoring you.

490
00:35:07.614 --> 00:35:08.813
I'm really sorry.

491
00:35:09.414 --> 00:35:12.454
It's only because people were watching. It's fine.

492
00:35:55.293 --> 00:35:57.034
I think you'd need this for self-protection.

493
00:35:57.134 --> 00:35:58.864
We're living in a dangerous world.

494
00:35:59.134 --> 00:36:02.333
I searched all night to choose the best one...

495
00:36:02.463 --> 00:36:04.574
so wear it 24 hours a day.

496
00:36:12.373 --> 00:36:13.514
If...

497
00:36:14.344 --> 00:36:16.454
I act like a stranger...

498
00:36:17.083 --> 00:36:19.353
or I don't seem like the person you know,

499
00:36:20.054 --> 00:36:21.483
how would you feel?

500
00:36:22.023 --> 00:36:23.054
It doesn't matter.

501
00:36:23.893 --> 00:36:26.393
That doesn't change the fact that you're Han Ye Ri.

502
00:36:29.833 --> 00:36:31.364
I can see everything.

503
00:36:31.764 --> 00:36:35.463
I see who you are and how honest and good you are.

504
00:36:40.704 --> 00:36:41.744
Ye Ri.

505
00:36:42.574 --> 00:36:45.414
I'm so relieved that you're who you are.

506
00:37:06.264 --> 00:37:07.434
It's here somewhere.

507
00:37:09.003 --> 00:37:10.003
(Map)

508
00:37:18.514 --> 00:37:20.014
Gosh, it's blood!

509
00:37:20.443 --> 00:37:21.884
Blood! Blood!

510
00:37:22.643 --> 00:37:25.713
This is a terror attack. This is a terror!

511
00:37:25.713 --> 00:37:28.753
What's this? Be careful!

512
00:37:29.083 --> 00:37:30.324
Thank you, Eun Ho.

513
00:37:30.324 --> 00:37:33.724
I have allergies, so this is the only water I can drink.

514
00:37:35.764 --> 00:37:36.833
(Pelog)

515
00:37:36.833 --> 00:37:40.134
Blood! Are you all right? You're bleeding.

516
00:37:40.134 --> 00:37:41.804
Blood? Blood?

517
00:37:41.804 --> 00:37:44.103
Who's bleeding? Eun Ho?

518
00:37:45.333 --> 00:37:47.074
I got you, Yoo Byung Cheol.

519
00:37:48.043 --> 00:37:51.514
You're probably the one that broke the scooter too.

520
00:38:02.384 --> 00:38:03.554
That scum.

521
00:38:03.923 --> 00:38:04.994
It wasn't me.

522
00:38:08.463 --> 00:38:10.833
- You did it. - No, I didn't.

523
00:38:13.364 --> 00:38:14.463
I didn't do it.

524
00:38:14.463 --> 00:38:16.474
Be honest with me. Then I'll forgive you.

525
00:38:16.574 --> 00:38:18.134
Why don't you believe me?

526
00:38:19.034 --> 00:38:20.204
How could I?

527
00:38:24.344 --> 00:38:25.474
I don't have anything to tell you.

528
00:38:26.583 --> 00:38:27.643
I'm leaving.

529
00:38:27.943 --> 00:38:29.583
You should tell me the truth before you leave.

530
00:38:31.154 --> 00:38:32.353
What truth?

531
00:38:34.284 --> 00:38:35.324
Gosh.

532
00:38:37.423 --> 00:38:38.753
You're not going to believe me anyway.

533
00:39:05.284 --> 00:39:07.853
This is probably enough. He won't treat me like a kid.

534
00:39:09.623 --> 00:39:11.023
Did I put in too much pads?

535
00:39:13.094 --> 00:39:14.523
Well, this is not bad.

536
00:39:24.603 --> 00:39:26.603
Gosh, that's so small.

537
00:39:27.173 --> 00:39:30.173
Are you ignoring me because I'm just a student?

538
00:39:30.273 --> 00:39:33.643
If you're trying to startle people, you should have something big...

539
00:39:33.744 --> 00:39:35.844
or something creative.

540
00:39:36.253 --> 00:39:39.213
Gosh, people think that students don't know anything,

541
00:39:39.313 --> 00:39:42.554
but we know everything, and we've seen everything.

542
00:39:44.023 --> 00:39:47.594
I thought... This isn't too bad.

543
00:39:47.693 --> 00:39:49.934
It is that bad. Gosh.

544
00:39:50.434 --> 00:39:53.134
I wasn't surprised at all.

545
00:39:54.264 --> 00:39:55.503
Gosh, you've got to be kidding me.

546
00:39:55.864 --> 00:39:57.833
I wasn't surprised at all.

547
00:40:05.014 --> 00:40:07.184
Don't come near me. Don't!

548
00:40:07.983 --> 00:40:10.353
Don't come near me.

549
00:40:10.884 --> 00:40:13.324
Gosh. Get away, you crazy pervert!

550
00:40:13.324 --> 00:40:14.423
Stop right there.

551
00:40:23.594 --> 00:40:24.833
Bye!

552
00:40:28.603 --> 00:40:29.603
Are you all right?

553
00:40:36.414 --> 00:40:39.114
I'm sorry for telling you to come here at this hour.

554
00:40:39.213 --> 00:40:42.014
No, it's fine. I was so happy that you texted me.

555
00:40:42.114 --> 00:40:43.654
I was just giving a shot.

556
00:40:44.054 --> 00:40:46.623
I didn't expect you to answer. I just wanted to try at least.

557
00:40:52.123 --> 00:40:55.164
Do you have a girlfriend?

558
00:40:56.094 --> 00:40:57.094
Yes.

559
00:40:58.463 --> 00:41:00.833
But I think she dumped me.

560
00:41:04.003 --> 00:41:06.543
- Why? - She has another man.

561
00:41:07.204 --> 00:41:09.373
He's handsome and popular with girls.

562
00:41:09.943 --> 00:41:11.914
But you're really handsome too.

563
00:41:12.373 --> 00:41:15.414
I don't know who she is, but she's not good at choosing men.

564
00:41:17.114 --> 00:41:20.423
By the way, I promised to give you a book. Choose something.

565
00:41:21.154 --> 00:41:22.224
All right.

566
00:41:31.193 --> 00:41:32.364
I have this book too.

567
00:41:35.534 --> 00:41:37.204
- Do you know that book? - Of course.

568
00:41:37.304 --> 00:41:40.704
It's written by an author that I really like called Sarangbagi.

569
00:41:41.173 --> 00:41:42.373
I really like this author too.

570
00:41:42.773 --> 00:41:45.014
Really? This is so cool.

571
00:41:45.344 --> 00:41:48.114
We must be destined to be.

572
00:41:48.344 --> 00:41:51.054
Yes, I feel like we're going to have a lot in common.

573
00:41:53.483 --> 00:41:55.753
I like this part the most.

574
00:41:55.853 --> 00:41:56.994
("Two-faced Couple")

575
00:42:03.293 --> 00:42:04.494
What did you do last night?

576
00:42:05.434 --> 00:42:06.563
I met someone.

577
00:42:07.204 --> 00:42:09.673
Who? Yoo Byung Cheol?

578
00:42:13.643 --> 00:42:14.974
Why would you meet him?

579
00:42:15.643 --> 00:42:16.813
You said he meant nothing to you.

580
00:42:18.373 --> 00:42:21.384
- Something came up. - What was it about?

581
00:42:21.844 --> 00:42:23.884
Why do you need to meet him?

582
00:42:26.423 --> 00:42:29.083
Gosh, why did I have to get hurt at a time like this?

583
00:42:32.594 --> 00:42:35.023
Tell me the truth. Why did you meet him?

584
00:42:36.123 --> 00:42:37.134
It was because of you.

585
00:42:37.634 --> 00:42:39.603
- I met him because of you. - What?

586
00:42:39.704 --> 00:42:43.873
He did this to your hand and the scooter.

587
00:42:44.603 --> 00:42:46.244
I went to warn him...

588
00:42:46.503 --> 00:42:49.813
that if he does something like this again, I won't let him get away.

589
00:42:53.744 --> 00:42:57.114
Are you asking me this because you thought I was cheating on you?

590
00:42:57.813 --> 00:43:00.224
No, it's not like that.

591
00:43:02.724 --> 00:43:03.824
Let's talk later.

592
00:43:10.764 --> 00:43:13.134
Gosh, she misunderstood me because I couldn't hear anything.

593
00:43:14.534 --> 00:43:19.204
Dissociative identity disorder.

594
00:43:19.404 --> 00:43:20.974
We call this a dual personality,

595
00:43:20.974 --> 00:43:24.744
multiple characters, or multiple identities.

596
00:43:26.244 --> 00:43:30.114
People who have lived near patients with this disorder...

597
00:43:30.414 --> 00:43:32.554
all say that it seems like...

598
00:43:32.983 --> 00:43:37.654
someone else is living in one body.

599
00:43:38.023 --> 00:43:40.023
Just like you.

600
00:43:41.793 --> 00:43:42.864
Okay.

601
00:43:43.963 --> 00:43:45.693
This is the end of class today.

602
00:43:45.833 --> 00:43:47.833
- Thank you. - Thank you.

603
00:43:51.934 --> 00:43:54.844
What if people see us?

604
00:43:54.943 --> 00:43:56.844
There's no class here all day.

605
00:43:58.074 --> 00:44:01.014
I'm sorry for what I did. Please forgive me.

606
00:44:01.483 --> 00:44:03.114
I want to go. I have a lot of things to do.

607
00:44:03.114 --> 00:44:04.583
I'm sorry.

608
00:44:05.054 --> 00:44:07.853
Please forgive me.

609
00:44:10.554 --> 00:44:13.623
- You're smiling right now, right? - I'm not.

610
00:44:13.623 --> 00:44:14.963
You are.

611
00:44:16.864 --> 00:44:20.103
- You are. - Don't tickle me. Gosh.

612
00:44:21.233 --> 00:44:24.773
- Why are you doing that? - Gosh.

613
00:44:25.434 --> 00:44:27.904
You're tickling me. Stop.

614
00:44:28.304 --> 00:44:30.574
- Oh, my. - Gosh.

615
00:44:34.244 --> 00:44:37.684
- Gosh, what is that? - Gosh.

616
00:44:38.313 --> 00:44:39.454
What are you doing?

617
00:44:39.454 --> 00:44:41.454
- Gosh. - Gosh.

618
00:44:41.884 --> 00:44:44.654
- Gosh. - Weren't you dating Jae Hee?

619
00:44:45.753 --> 00:44:46.824
No.

620
00:44:47.023 --> 00:44:50.534
- Then are you dating her? - Her?

621
00:44:51.634 --> 00:44:54.864
- Gosh, no. - That's impossible.

622
00:44:55.804 --> 00:44:58.804
- No. - Gosh.

623
00:44:58.904 --> 00:45:03.143
Please, don't. Please. No. Please.

624
00:45:03.273 --> 00:45:05.673
What if you get caught?

625
00:45:06.943 --> 00:45:10.753
We won't. We decided to keep it a secret.

626
00:45:10.853 --> 00:45:12.253
But still...

627
00:45:12.884 --> 00:45:14.454
if people find out...

628
00:45:16.324 --> 00:45:17.324
Han Ju Ri...

629
00:45:18.523 --> 00:45:19.824
She'll come out.

630
00:45:21.063 --> 00:45:22.994
And she'll do everything she can...

631
00:45:23.333 --> 00:45:25.594
to take Eun Ho away from me.

632
00:45:26.164 --> 00:45:28.864
- No. - Gosh.

633
00:45:28.963 --> 00:45:31.974
Tell us something, Eun Ho. What's your relationship with her?

634
00:45:31.974 --> 00:45:33.904
What do you think?

635
00:45:34.404 --> 00:45:35.474
Eun Ho.

636
00:45:35.673 --> 00:45:37.943
How can you date someone...

637
00:45:37.943 --> 00:45:41.313
that your close friend liked? You're acting all cute and stuff.

638
00:45:41.313 --> 00:45:44.554
It's not like that. He just liked her by himself.

639
00:45:44.554 --> 00:45:45.684
For me, it's not like that.

640
00:45:46.753 --> 00:45:48.654
No, please.

641
00:45:48.654 --> 00:45:50.154
We're dating.

642
00:45:50.154 --> 00:45:53.164
- Stop it. - I like Han Ye Ri.

643
00:45:53.164 --> 00:45:54.664
- Gosh. - No.

644
00:45:55.463 --> 00:45:57.094
- How can you do that? - Gosh.

645
00:45:59.563 --> 00:46:00.664
Gosh.

646
00:46:01.164 --> 00:46:02.233
Ye Ri.

647
00:46:02.664 --> 00:46:05.404
Ye Ri, what's wrong? Are you feeling all right?

648
00:46:05.503 --> 00:46:06.943
- What's wrong? - Gosh.

649
00:46:07.304 --> 00:46:08.443
What's wrong?

650
00:46:08.443 --> 00:46:10.014
- Ye Ri. - I don't think she's joking.

651
00:46:10.514 --> 00:46:11.643
Han Ye Ri.

652
00:46:35.833 --> 00:46:36.833
Ye Ri.

653
00:46:52.313 --> 00:46:54.824
If people get to know that I'm being loved,

654
00:46:55.884 --> 00:46:57.793
the monster in me awakes.

655
00:46:58.224 --> 00:46:59.253
Hello.

656
00:47:00.123 --> 00:47:01.264
She's dangerous.

657
00:47:01.864 --> 00:47:03.434
Run away from me, Eun Ho.

658
00:47:08.534 --> 00:47:09.574
Gosh.

659
00:47:10.273 --> 00:47:12.873
- What is happening? - What are they doing?

660
00:47:29.483 --> 00:47:32.994
(Meloholic)

661
00:47:33.224 --> 00:47:34.923
Don't move and keep still.

662
00:47:37.063 --> 00:47:39.193
I'm scared of looking into her mind.

663
00:47:40.034 --> 00:47:42.233
You're going to die today.

664
00:47:42.534 --> 00:47:43.934
The genre changed.

665
00:47:44.233 --> 00:47:45.603
But it's so different.

666
00:47:46.474 --> 00:47:47.603
Are you drunk?

667
00:47:49.543 --> 00:47:51.213
I know your secret.

668
00:47:51.213 --> 00:47:52.713
Miss Han Ye Ri?

669
00:47:53.313 --> 00:47:55.213
Your girlfriend must have the same name as my girlfriend.

670
00:47:56.143 --> 00:47:57.654
Where is it?

671
00:47:57.954 --> 00:47:58.954
Gosh.

672
00:47:58.954 --> 00:48:00.253
Don't lie to me.

673
00:48:00.753 --> 00:48:01.824
Ye Ri.

674
00:48:02.583 --> 00:48:03.623
I'm sorry.

675
00:48:04.724 --> 00:48:05.793
I'm sorry.
