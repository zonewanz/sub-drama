1
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:12.751
That can't be called a kiss.

2
00:00:13.591 --> 00:00:16.161
Okay, I was bad at it.

3
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.490
Yes, exactly.

4
00:00:18.931 --> 00:00:20.091
This is...

5
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.260
how you kiss.

6
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.661
Do you get it now?

7
00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.731
Or...

8
00:01:00.941 --> 00:01:02.600
should we do it more?

9
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.811
I want to do it more.

10
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.191
Ji Ho?

11
00:01:55.191 --> 00:01:57.490
Your phone's ringing.

12
00:01:58.331 --> 00:01:59.590
Hey, Ji Ho.

13
00:02:00.361 --> 00:02:02.100
Ji Ho.

14
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.041
- Your phone. - Yes.

15
00:02:16.041 --> 00:02:18.081
Yes, Mom. What is it?

16
00:02:18.081 --> 00:02:20.111
What do you mean? Where did you two go?

17
00:02:20.111 --> 00:02:22.421
- Why aren't you back? - Where do you think?

18
00:02:22.481 --> 00:02:23.620
We're at the beach.

19
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.521
What would we do at the beach? We're looking at the water.

20
00:02:29.761 --> 00:02:31.731
Yes. Okay.

21
00:02:32.291 --> 00:02:34.731
We'll come now. Bye.

22
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.970
Shall we go back?

23
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.340
Yes.

24
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.590
I think you sounded too angry with your mother.

25
00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.021
Me? When?

26
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.231
My voice gets louder when I talk in my accent.

27
00:03:07.231 --> 00:03:10.701
When I was in university, my friends would ask me...

28
00:03:10.761 --> 00:03:12.831
why I'm so mad when I talk to my mom on the phone.

29
00:03:13.101 --> 00:03:15.101
I guess that makes sense.

30
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.011
From what I noticed today, the people here...

31
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.310
change lax consonants into an aspirated consonant...

32
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.780
or a hard consonant.

33
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.881
For example, "I'll do it" sounds like "I'll do it".

34
00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.521
Then, "I'm going to do it" to "I'm going to do it".

35
00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.720
Did you analyze it already?

36
00:03:33.951 --> 00:03:37.660
Yes. I need to understand in order to make kimchi.

37
00:03:40.731 --> 00:03:44.530
Right. I noticed that they say "pretty" like this.

38
00:03:45.271 --> 00:03:46.731
When did you catch that?

39
00:03:47.671 --> 00:03:51.541
Did the ladies make fun of you and call you pretty?

40
00:03:51.641 --> 00:03:52.771
No.

41
00:03:53.011 --> 00:03:55.041
Not me. You.

42
00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.810
They asked me...

43
00:03:59.011 --> 00:04:00.280
if I think you're pretty.

44
00:04:05.791 --> 00:04:08.620
Let's go. She'll call you again.

45
00:04:13.231 --> 00:04:14.430
What was that?

46
00:04:14.761 --> 00:04:16.831
He didn't finish his sentence.

47
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.511
We'll get going then.

48
00:04:33.811 --> 00:04:35.850
Also, thank you for the kimchi.

49
00:04:35.951 --> 00:04:38.350
Sure. Always...

50
00:04:38.891 --> 00:04:41.021
be careful of cars, people,

51
00:04:41.021 --> 00:04:42.761
and wars.

52
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.931
If anything happens,

53
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.761
come here right away. Okay?

54
00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.670
If a war breaks out, Seoul will be the first to go.

55
00:04:51.931 --> 00:04:53.831
Don't delay your time there,

56
00:04:53.831 --> 00:04:55.900
- and come right down. - You better go.

57
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.071
You have work tomorrow.

58
00:04:57.071 --> 00:05:00.040
Hey, where is your son-in-law going?

59
00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.280
Yes, we have to go home now.

60
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.110
Go back in. They're busy.

61
00:05:06.451 --> 00:05:08.581
You're not the only one. I'm busy too.

62
00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.050
If you want to leave, you have to have this drink.

63
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.991
If you don't, you can't go.

64
00:05:13.991 --> 00:05:16.660
No, I'm okay. I'll have to stop drinking.

65
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.230
Did you just say no to a drink from an adult?

66
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.181
Here. Happy?

67
00:05:35.181 --> 00:05:37.181
That wasn't for you.

68
00:05:38.311 --> 00:05:39.410
Listen.

69
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.121
If you bother my husband again,

70
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.251
I'll put...

71
00:05:46.191 --> 00:05:48.160
your son-in-law...

72
00:05:48.821 --> 00:05:50.790
in a liquor jug.

73
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.331
Got that?

74
00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.831
I didn't bother him.

75
00:05:59.331 --> 00:06:00.900
Just go inside!

76
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:09.480
We're going.

77
00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.951
- Bye. - Okay.

78
00:06:10.951 --> 00:06:13.350
- Take care. - We'll drive them.

79
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.181
- We'll be back. - Okay.

80
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.521
- Bye, Ji Ho. - Bye.

81
00:06:19.821 --> 00:06:22.460
It's been a while since you stood up to that uncle.

82
00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.331
Why? Did something like this happen before?

83
00:06:25.331 --> 00:06:28.400
Yes. Long time ago,

84
00:06:28.761 --> 00:06:31.470
there was a stray dog Ji Ho used to look after.

85
00:06:31.631 --> 00:06:34.600
Then that uncle took it away to have it.

86
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.641
What? Don't tell me he was going to eat the dog.

87
00:06:37.641 --> 00:06:39.371
That's exactly why.

88
00:06:39.811 --> 00:06:41.511
And then what?

89
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.710
What do you think? Ji Ho...

90
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:47.110
took his cultivator to the quayside and turned on the engine.

91
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.581
She threatened him to release the dog.

92
00:06:51.191 --> 00:06:52.251
Ji Ho.

93
00:06:53.251 --> 00:06:54.261
You're awesome.

94
00:06:54.561 --> 00:06:56.420
That's such an old story.

95
00:06:56.991 --> 00:07:00.191
If my sister gives her heart to something, it lasts forever.

96
00:07:01.331 --> 00:07:03.501
You'll be tied down forever, Se Hee.

97
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.470
Watch where you're driving.

98
00:07:06.871 --> 00:07:08.040
I got it.

99
00:07:14.881 --> 00:07:17.040
Thank you and take care of yourself.

100
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:18.910
- Go. - Okay.

101
00:07:19.881 --> 00:07:21.321
Take care.

102
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.321
Thank you. Bye.

103
00:07:42.201 --> 00:07:43.900
- Bye. - Bye.

104
00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:50.951
Shall we get going, my babies?

105
00:07:58.290 --> 00:07:59.391
What's wrong?

106
00:07:59.821 --> 00:08:03.021
I think Ji Ho and Se Hee are a little strange.

107
00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:04.230
What is?

108
00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:05.660
They look...

109
00:08:06.991 --> 00:08:08.100
naive.

110
00:08:09.261 --> 00:08:10.931
They're newlyweds. Of course they look like that.

111
00:08:11.001 --> 00:08:13.600
No, it's not like that.

112
00:08:14.001 --> 00:08:17.001
It feels like when we were just starting to date.

113
00:08:17.001 --> 00:08:19.670
What are you talking about? They're already married.

114
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:21.410
Let's go, I'm cold.

115
00:08:24.381 --> 00:08:27.011
A married couple would never make faces like that.

116
00:08:36.861 --> 00:08:38.231
My seat is here.

117
00:08:38.891 --> 00:08:40.861
- You're in the back, right? - Yes.

118
00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:43.731
I'm over there.

119
00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:49.641
Should I ask the person next to you...

120
00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:53.271
if they could switch seats?

121
00:08:56.981 --> 00:08:58.080
No.

122
00:08:58.611 --> 00:09:00.820
It'd be best to just sit where we're assigned.

123
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:04.591
I think asking to switch seats might be...

124
00:09:04.591 --> 00:09:06.091
bad manners to someone else.

125
00:09:06.991 --> 00:09:10.790
It may seem like nothing, but it's hard to say no.

126
00:09:12.391 --> 00:09:15.530
Okay. Now that I think about it, you're right.

127
00:09:22.271 --> 00:09:26.111
In dramas and movies that filled my childhood,

128
00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:32.351
kissing represented a happy ending.

129
00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:38.320
However,

130
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:41.861
I now understand why the kiss...

131
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:44.560
had to be the ending.

132
00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.660
(To my everything and my love Se Hee)

133
00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:51.430
The real story starts after it.

134
00:09:53.631 --> 00:09:55.601
(Visitor)

135
00:09:56.641 --> 00:09:58.371
(Take care and live well. But don't fall in love again.)

136
00:09:58.371 --> 00:10:00.111
(You don't deserve to.)

137
00:10:01.981 --> 00:10:03.481
And people...

138
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:11.091
don't want to watch the truth.

139
00:10:14.591 --> 00:10:15.861
The real story...

140
00:10:16.861 --> 00:10:20.261
could be painful...

141
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:22.861
and dark.

142
00:10:29.501 --> 00:10:31.341
A kiss or a marriage...

143
00:10:32.511 --> 00:10:37.241
doesn't mean it's a happy ending in real life.

144
00:10:42.381 --> 00:10:47.221
The drama between that man and I only just begun.

145
00:10:47.861 --> 00:10:49.021
And...

146
00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:03.841
my desires...

147
00:11:05.241 --> 00:11:07.341
only just begun too.

148
00:11:16.981 --> 00:11:18.251
This is trouble.

149
00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:21.861
All of my romantic cells inside of me...

150
00:11:24.761 --> 00:11:26.190
woke up.

151
00:11:27.391 --> 00:11:31.030
(Because This Is My First Desire)

152
00:11:35.971 --> 00:11:37.741
- Hello. - Hello.

153
00:11:38.271 --> 00:11:40.271
Are you just coming home when it's morning?

154
00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:43.011
We went to my parents'.

155
00:11:43.111 --> 00:11:45.180
You should go in.

156
00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:46.511
- Take care. - Bye.

157
00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.731
How have you been?

158
00:11:59.231 --> 00:12:01.300
We came back pretty fast, right?

159
00:12:04.101 --> 00:12:05.971
You should have slept over.

160
00:12:05.971 --> 00:12:07.430
You haven't visited them in a while.

161
00:12:07.741 --> 00:12:09.400
No, I have work too.

162
00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.771
Bok Nam switched shifts for me.

163
00:12:12.211 --> 00:12:15.611
You should get some sleep even if it's just a few hours.

164
00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.280
Okay.

165
00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:31.190
I had fun making kimchi.

166
00:12:32.991 --> 00:12:34.231
The beach too.

167
00:12:35.461 --> 00:12:38.400
Yes. Me too.

168
00:12:43.871 --> 00:12:45.871
You should go in first.

169
00:12:46.711 --> 00:12:49.381
No, you go ahead.

170
00:12:49.381 --> 00:12:52.410
No, I should see you go in.

171
00:12:55.521 --> 00:12:56.621
Okay, then.

172
00:14:08.861 --> 00:14:10.521
Now that I think about it,

173
00:14:12.091 --> 00:14:14.731
we don't have a proper picture together.

174
00:14:20.471 --> 00:14:22.570
(Husband)

175
00:14:36.751 --> 00:14:37.920
Are you sleeping?

176
00:14:39.621 --> 00:14:41.221
No. Not yet.

177
00:14:42.391 --> 00:14:45.091
I have something to ask you.

178
00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.060
Why did you do that?

179
00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:49.660
Why would you ask him?

180
00:14:55.141 --> 00:14:59.241
When the ladies asked you if you thought I was pretty,

181
00:14:59.841 --> 00:15:01.711
what did you say?

182
00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:23.761
I told them that I think you're pretty.

183
00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.621
I wish we could sleep together...

184
00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:19.721
in one bed.

185
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:30.560
Why? What's wrong with me?

186
00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:34.141
I'm disgusting.

187
00:17:02.101 --> 00:17:05.001
I'm going to work. Heat up the soup before you eat it.

188
00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:28.360
Here. Where are you going?

189
00:17:28.991 --> 00:17:30.161
To the zoo.

190
00:17:30.521 --> 00:17:32.890
You have to answer in a full sentence.

191
00:17:32.991 --> 00:17:34.731
I'm going to the zoo.

192
00:17:36.231 --> 00:17:37.570
Thank you.

193
00:17:37.671 --> 00:17:39.830
- Thank her. - Thank you.

194
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:41.441
There comes the car.

195
00:17:42.471 --> 00:17:43.941
Let's go.

196
00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:45.741
- Hello. - Hello.

197
00:17:45.741 --> 00:17:47.310
- Hello. - Have a great day.

198
00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:49.211
- I'll see you later. - See you.

199
00:17:50.411 --> 00:17:52.251
- Listen to your teacher. - Bye.

200
00:17:52.251 --> 00:17:54.521
- Have a good day. - Bye.

201
00:17:54.521 --> 00:17:55.921
Don't cry.

202
00:17:56.151 --> 00:17:58.521
Have fun today.

203
00:18:03.421 --> 00:18:05.231
(Won Seok)

204
00:18:09.461 --> 00:18:11.401
- Hello? - Are you on your way to work?

205
00:18:12.201 --> 00:18:14.171
Yes, I'm on a bus.

206
00:18:15.001 --> 00:18:16.471
You work only in the morning today, right?

207
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:17.971
Yes.

208
00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.481
Where should we meet later today?

209
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:24.211
The play starts at 7pm.

210
00:18:25.011 --> 00:18:26.580
I'll see you at Daehangno around that time.

211
00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.451
Okay, I'll see you later.

212
00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:30.181
Ho Rang.

213
00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.251
Yes?

214
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:34.661
I love you.

215
00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:41.431
Well... Me too.

216
00:18:44.001 --> 00:18:45.201
I love you too.

217
00:18:46.201 --> 00:18:47.330
Bye.

218
00:19:12.491 --> 00:19:14.130
It's not comfortable at all.

219
00:19:14.701 --> 00:19:16.630
And they all look ugly.

220
00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:30.511
Goodness.

221
00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:43.161
(Customized underwear)

222
00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:47.661
Okay.

223
00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.630
How did you wear a bra all along? It must've been so uncomfortable.

224
00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:55.901
I didn't wear it half of the time.

225
00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:59.370
Strangely, my underarm felt so uncomfortable whenever I wore it.

226
00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:02.741
It's because your chest shape is different from others.

227
00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:05.411
- Really? - Yes.

228
00:20:05.711 --> 00:20:09.880
All faces are shaped differently and so are the breasts.

229
00:20:10.151 --> 00:20:12.921
Their sizes and where they're located.

230
00:20:13.221 --> 00:20:15.890
Whether they're wide or narrow is slightly different too.

231
00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:17.530
But people don't know well about it.

232
00:20:17.731 --> 00:20:20.491
They just push them in a bra if it's the right size.

233
00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:21.961
No wonder it's not comfortable.

234
00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.771
I guess quite a lot of people come here for customized underwear.

235
00:20:27.771 --> 00:20:28.870
Yes.

236
00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:31.340
I do this only as a side job after marriage.

237
00:20:31.671 --> 00:20:33.711
But they visit me somehow.

238
00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:38.481
Right.

239
00:20:39.011 --> 00:20:40.820
You have a lot of information too.

240
00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:48.021
Well, how about you make data with these...

241
00:20:48.221 --> 00:20:50.790
and create bras...

242
00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:52.860
according to different breast shapes?

243
00:20:54.201 --> 00:20:55.300
Data?

244
00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:58.300
Yes. For example,

245
00:20:58.501 --> 00:21:00.941
bras for pigeon chest, flat chest, and saggy chest.

246
00:21:00.941 --> 00:21:02.870
Categorize your products...

247
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:05.711
and recommend the right type of bras that fits customers.

248
00:21:05.741 --> 00:21:09.181
Then they can choose the type and make a purchase right away online...

249
00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.050
without having to visit all the way here.

250
00:21:13.211 --> 00:21:15.521
I don't know much about that kind of stuff.

251
00:21:16.181 --> 00:21:19.521
I just want to make use of the skills I learned before marriage.

252
00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:21.890
And I love to make bras myself for each customer...

253
00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:24.360
after talking with them in person.

254
00:21:25.431 --> 00:21:26.830
That's why I'm doing this.

255
00:21:28.231 --> 00:21:31.171
Sorry, it was too materialistic of me.

256
00:21:31.471 --> 00:21:34.570
No, you said it for my sake.

257
00:21:35.271 --> 00:21:38.640
It's because I'm not good at doing business.

258
00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.110
Oh, how much is it?

259
00:21:42.481 --> 00:21:44.411
It's 250 dollars.

260
00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:56.790
What?

261
00:22:07.671 --> 00:22:08.840
Se Hee.

262
00:22:11.941 --> 00:22:13.110
Se Hee.

263
00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:18.651
I fell asleep for a while.

264
00:22:19.951 --> 00:22:21.921
What are you doing here? It's a weekend.

265
00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.620
I came to get massaged.

266
00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.590
You went to make kimchi to Ji Ho's house yesterday, right?

267
00:22:29.721 --> 00:22:30.761
Yes.

268
00:22:30.761 --> 00:22:34.261
I didn't think this would be solved by applying pain-relief patches.

269
00:22:37.001 --> 00:22:40.271
What are you doing here on a weekend?

270
00:22:44.171 --> 00:22:45.340
For a massage?

271
00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:47.840
No, I'm going on a date...

272
00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.441
and just stopping by here for work.

273
00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:53.211
I see. Enjoy your date.

274
00:22:54.151 --> 00:22:55.251
Thanks.

275
00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.790
Well, Se Hee.

276
00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:06.360
You love Ji Ho very much, don't you?

277
00:23:09.431 --> 00:23:10.800
That's...

278
00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:13.671
Nothing. I shouldn't have asked you that.

279
00:23:13.931 --> 00:23:16.140
Then enjoy your massage.

280
00:23:19.271 --> 00:23:20.471
Do you want to...

281
00:23:24.011 --> 00:23:25.280
have some coffee with me?

282
00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:41.931
Is your marriage plan...

283
00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.100
not working great?

284
00:23:46.171 --> 00:23:47.330
I don't know.

285
00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:50.201
I'm not sure if it's my marriage plan or relationship with her...

286
00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:52.741
that's not going great.

287
00:23:53.711 --> 00:23:55.981
Or if it's my love.

288
00:23:57.011 --> 00:23:59.481
I guess you're having arguments often.

289
00:24:00.211 --> 00:24:02.151
We've always argued often.

290
00:24:03.151 --> 00:24:05.721
We yelled at each other on a street once.

291
00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:09.261
We threw a back rib at each other at a restaurant once too.

292
00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:13.790
We've fought like martial arts players for the last seven years.

293
00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:16.600
But now...

294
00:24:18.971 --> 00:24:20.800
Do you know how we are these days?

295
00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:25.370
We don't argue.

296
00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:30.850
We're aware that we're thinking very differently,

297
00:24:31.511 --> 00:24:33.080
but we don't argue.

298
00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:37.120
- Because if we do... - It might be irreversible.

299
00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:41.661
Right.

300
00:24:47.431 --> 00:24:50.330
Actually, Ji Ho and I...

301
00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:53.870
didn't get married out of love.

302
00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:57.441
It was just that...

303
00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:00.171
everything matched our interests.

304
00:25:00.511 --> 00:25:01.880
That's why we decided to get married.

305
00:25:03.211 --> 00:25:06.580
Because we didn't feel uncomfortable with each other.

306
00:25:09.451 --> 00:25:10.921
But after then...

307
00:25:11.491 --> 00:25:12.790
Did you grow to have feelings for her?

308
00:25:15.421 --> 00:25:16.521
Yes.

309
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:21.001
I realized through this marriage...

310
00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:22.860
that my heart...

311
00:25:24.201 --> 00:25:25.931
allows there to be room...

312
00:25:26.401 --> 00:25:28.441
when I find myself at peace.

313
00:25:29.971 --> 00:25:32.610
So love and marriage are separate matters.

314
00:25:33.671 --> 00:25:35.441
That's not my point.

315
00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:38.181
I'm saying you need to be honest to each other.

316
00:25:39.511 --> 00:25:42.181
Humans are selfish beings to begin with.

317
00:25:42.451 --> 00:25:45.390
And marriage is one of the systems...

318
00:25:45.491 --> 00:25:47.991
in which their selfish desire shows up most clearly.

319
00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:50.931
Desire?

320
00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:54.461
Se Hee, I don't have such desire.

321
00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.401
I simply like to see Ho Rang smile.

322
00:25:59.271 --> 00:26:01.600
I want to make her happy.

323
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:06.271
And most of all, I can't live...

324
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:09.080
without her.

325
00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:13.681
We all know that, so we can't be any more honest.

326
00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:22.261
"I..."

327
00:26:23.161 --> 00:26:25.191
"like to see you smile."

328
00:26:25.991 --> 00:26:29.100
"I want to make you happy."

329
00:26:30.461 --> 00:26:34.140
"I can't live without you."

330
00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:37.401
What you just said...

331
00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:39.271
all starts...

332
00:26:40.411 --> 00:26:42.110
with you as the subject.

333
00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:47.310
Your sentences don't start with the other person.

334
00:26:50.451 --> 00:26:51.550
Well, then.

335
00:26:52.521 --> 00:26:53.921
Enjoy your date.

336
00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:05.231
By the way,

337
00:27:06.471 --> 00:27:09.640
what do people do...

338
00:27:10.401 --> 00:27:11.640
on a date these days?

339
00:28:00.751 --> 00:28:01.961
What's going on?

340
00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:04.931
What?

341
00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:08.701
It's so dirty.

342
00:28:09.201 --> 00:28:12.870
This table is unacceptably dirty.

343
00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:17.570
Where have you been?

344
00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:20.110
I went to the custom underwear shop.

345
00:28:22.011 --> 00:28:23.810
Oh, I remember you told me about that.

346
00:28:24.681 --> 00:28:27.521
That's cool. Should I try there too?

347
00:28:28.651 --> 00:28:29.880
Isn't it expensive though?

348
00:28:30.021 --> 00:28:31.550
It's really expensive.

349
00:28:33.991 --> 00:28:36.790
Show me your breasts.

350
00:28:37.191 --> 00:28:38.290
What?

351
00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:40.530
What am I showing you?

352
00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.441
- The online business? - Yes.

353
00:28:51.711 --> 00:28:55.780
If there's a way people can figure out the type of their shapes,

354
00:28:56.181 --> 00:28:59.151
the custom underwear will be popular among people. Don't you agree?

355
00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:03.350
That's true. I don't see why not.

356
00:29:04.451 --> 00:29:06.191
Are you thinking of doing it?

357
00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:08.921
How can I do that? I have my work already.

358
00:29:10.021 --> 00:29:13.030
It sounds interesting. So I might just do it for fun.

359
00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:15.701
I can give my materials to the designer too.

360
00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:20.431
Why don't you do it?

361
00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.340
You've always wanted to run your own business.

362
00:29:25.411 --> 00:29:28.640
Why don't you just do it when you have an idea like now?

363
00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:32.911
How can I quit such a job?

364
00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:35.651
It is very frustrating, but they do pay me the most in the industry.

365
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:38.491
And...

366
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:42.221
you know my life isn't solely mine.

367
00:29:42.921 --> 00:29:44.021
I...

368
00:29:46.761 --> 00:29:50.261
My life is pretty different from yours.

369
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:54.870
I'm sorry. I just...

370
00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:59.471
I just saw your eyes sparkling while you talked about it.

371
00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:00.981
That's why I said so.

372
00:30:01.911 --> 00:30:03.610
Were they?

373
00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:05.681
Yes.

374
00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:10.481
Was it like your eyes when you talk about your landlord?

375
00:30:11.451 --> 00:30:13.590
What does that have to do with it?

376
00:30:16.161 --> 00:30:19.130
I'm seriously curious about something.

377
00:30:20.191 --> 00:30:21.860
Don't you want to do it with him?

378
00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:25.501
- What do I do with him? - It's a guy you like.

379
00:30:25.671 --> 00:30:27.300
You guys are living together.

380
00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:29.971
Is your body okay?

381
00:30:30.171 --> 00:30:32.370
He's right in the next room. Don't you want it?

382
00:30:33.011 --> 00:30:35.040
I don't want it. What do you mean?

383
00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.640
Why would I feel that way?

384
00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:37.951
I don't know what you are talking about.

385
00:30:38.181 --> 00:30:41.021
Really? That's interesting.

386
00:30:42.251 --> 00:30:43.751
Is it because you've never dated anyone yet?

387
00:30:43.981 --> 00:30:45.320
Is it because you don't know anything?

388
00:30:53.491 --> 00:30:55.060
But you still need to be careful, Ji Ho.

389
00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:58.271
Don't get physically close to him if you don't want to sleep with him.

390
00:30:58.671 --> 00:31:00.100
- Why not? - What do you mean?

391
00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:02.201
Do you not remember my first boyfriend back in college?

392
00:31:03.001 --> 00:31:04.741
Do you mean the one who only held your hand for six months?

393
00:31:04.741 --> 00:31:07.040
Yes. I was even depressed then.

394
00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:08.441
He just didn't do anything more than that.

395
00:31:08.711 --> 00:31:11.411
So, if you don't want to go further and further,

396
00:31:11.411 --> 00:31:13.280
don't even think about starting anything.

397
00:31:14.681 --> 00:31:17.991
The first desire is the biggest one.

398
00:31:17.991 --> 00:31:19.521
Especially when you've never dated anyone.

399
00:31:19.521 --> 00:31:22.491
It's like opening the Pandora's box. Do you get it?

400
00:31:29.401 --> 00:31:30.501
That's right.

401
00:31:31.501 --> 00:31:33.600
There's something I didn't take into account...

402
00:31:34.241 --> 00:31:38.040
for this contractual marriage.

403
00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:41.211
I went to the girls' middle school and high school,

404
00:31:41.211 --> 00:31:42.310
Look at that.

405
00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:44.651
and I have never dated anyone back in college.

406
00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:48.580
I'm single since birth.

407
00:31:49.951 --> 00:31:51.191
That's me.

408
00:31:52.421 --> 00:31:55.360
And I'm living with a guy I like.

409
00:31:55.461 --> 00:31:58.261
- I did it! - Awesome! I knew it!

410
00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:00.330
- Wow. How are you so good? - And he's the one...

411
00:32:00.431 --> 00:32:04.300
who opened the Pandora's box of mine.

412
00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:07.330
How are you so good at it? Is it not your first time?

413
00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:09.800
The beginners are always the fearless ones...

414
00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.011
because they know nothing.

415
00:32:11.011 --> 00:32:14.441
I know. They surely are.

416
00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:20.011
How many times am I thinking about that kiss a day? How stupid!

417
00:32:31.931 --> 00:32:33.590
Do you have a headache?

418
00:32:35.261 --> 00:32:36.401
I'm fine.

419
00:32:37.161 --> 00:32:38.600
What are you doing here?

420
00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:41.501
I dropped by the office and came here in case.

421
00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:44.610
I thought you were done with work by now.

422
00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:52.951
It's going to be the weekend soon. Do you want to do anything?

423
00:32:54.681 --> 00:32:56.221
What I want to do?

424
00:32:58.451 --> 00:33:00.290
I want to...

425
00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:02.390
Yes.

426
00:33:02.761 --> 00:33:06.590
Do you want to do anything?

427
00:33:17.911 --> 00:33:20.241
No, I don't. I don't want anything.

428
00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:25.181
There's nothing I want.

429
00:33:31.751 --> 00:33:32.850
Then,

430
00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:36.820
do you want to do what I want to do?

431
00:34:09.191 --> 00:34:11.531
Why don't we go see that?

432
00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:13.660
Okay.

433
00:34:43.684 --> 00:34:46.916
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E12 Because This is My First Life

434
00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:18.191
Cats can choose to only remember...

435
00:35:18.191 --> 00:35:19.830
things that are important to them.

436
00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:24.330
They can just forget things easily that are not pleasant to them.

437
00:35:24.771 --> 00:35:27.540
That's the reason why I like cats.

438
00:35:30.771 --> 00:35:32.711
- What about you, Ji Ho? - What?

439
00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:35.810
Do you like any animals?

440
00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.810
Animals?

441
00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:41.751
I like snails.

442
00:35:42.551 --> 00:35:43.850
Snails?

443
00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:46.620
Yes, I like snails.

444
00:35:47.151 --> 00:35:50.290
They always have homes.

445
00:35:51.191 --> 00:35:53.060
That's true.

446
00:35:53.631 --> 00:35:56.330
They are born in them.

447
00:35:57.870 --> 00:35:59.731
That's a new interpretation.

448
00:36:08.611 --> 00:36:10.711
Do you want to do that?

449
00:36:10.850 --> 00:36:13.551
What? What do you want now?

450
00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:18.321
I'm talking about that.

451
00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:22.220
I see.

452
00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:33.801
You just want to be in love

453
00:36:34.401 --> 00:36:38.970
You just want to be in love

454
00:36:46.711 --> 00:36:48.981
- Ho Rang. - You are here.

455
00:36:54.021 --> 00:36:55.490
We have a lot of time.

456
00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:56.890
We do.

457
00:36:58.461 --> 00:36:59.731
Do you want me to carry your bag?

458
00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:01.731
No, it's okay.

459
00:37:06.731 --> 00:37:08.401
That guy's really bad at that.

460
00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:38.501
- Ji Ho. - Oh, hey.

461
00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:41.271
- Oh, you are seeing a play, right? - Yes.

462
00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:45.370
Why is he playing that? It's so not like him.

463
00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:48.981
I don't know too. He suddenly wanted to play it.

464
00:37:49.341 --> 00:37:50.740
Oh, it's part of a date.

465
00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:52.981
- What? - He asked me earlier...

466
00:37:52.981 --> 00:37:55.450
what people do during their dates.

467
00:37:55.781 --> 00:37:58.251
So I told him a few.

468
00:37:58.790 --> 00:37:59.950
A date?

469
00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:03.591
- He's so lousy. - Goodness.

470
00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:13.001
I can do better than that.

471
00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:20.370
I want to try more for 10 dollars.

472
00:38:20.841 --> 00:38:22.441
- He must be rich. - He's playing again?

473
00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:24.010
That's unbelievable.

474
00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:30.551
Can I try it this time?

475
00:38:32.921 --> 00:38:34.660
Sure. Go ahead.

476
00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:51.571
- That's amazing. - She's good.

477
00:39:40.321 --> 00:39:42.620
(My Honey Sang Goo)

478
00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:49.901
How could you play that for 20 dollars?

479
00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:52.901
Did you want to have that doll that much?

480
00:39:53.731 --> 00:39:56.841
This is yours.

481
00:39:58.671 --> 00:40:00.111
Is it?

482
00:40:00.671 --> 00:40:01.740
Yes.

483
00:40:02.111 --> 00:40:04.281
That's why I picked a snail instead of a cat.

484
00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:11.720
You carry it since it's yours.

485
00:40:12.651 --> 00:40:15.720
Can't you just carry it for me? It's kind of heavy.

486
00:40:16.021 --> 00:40:18.930
- And this too. - What again? My hands are full.

487
00:40:19.591 --> 00:40:22.430
You have to carry it since it's yours.

488
00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:33.540
The person you're reaching...

489
00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:36.180
Why isn't she picking up her phone?

490
00:40:38.711 --> 00:40:41.120
I'm sorry for keeping you waiting.

491
00:40:41.481 --> 00:40:42.580
Hey.

492
00:40:42.751 --> 00:40:44.191
I'm so sorry.

493
00:40:44.350 --> 00:40:46.890
I didn't know how fast time went because I was working.

494
00:40:47.461 --> 00:40:49.921
Why did you turn off your phone?

495
00:40:49.921 --> 00:40:51.091
Did you call me?

496
00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:56.560
I left it at home.

497
00:40:56.861 --> 00:41:00.131
So why did you stop me from going to your house?

498
00:41:00.271 --> 00:41:02.301
Why are you so stubborn?

499
00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:04.711
I'm sorry.

500
00:41:06.711 --> 00:41:09.841
Are you not wearing your bra today?

501
00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:11.350
No.

502
00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:14.450
I'm wearing my bra, but not my underwear.

503
00:41:16.921 --> 00:41:18.421
Are you really doing this?

504
00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:22.921
Are you serious?

505
00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:25.660
You can check it out yourself.

506
00:41:26.091 --> 00:41:28.930
Soo Ji, you punk.

507
00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:31.830
If that's true, you're in big trouble.

508
00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:34.941
It's getting cold, so you should wear your underwear!

509
00:41:34.941 --> 00:41:36.671
Okay, let me take a look.

510
00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:37.941
Come here!

511
00:41:37.941 --> 00:41:40.711
I have to see if you're lying!

512
00:41:49.651 --> 00:41:52.251
What's that? You carry your own dryer?

513
00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:56.120
Yes, the ones here are weak. I'm used to mine.

514
00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:59.191
So why do you have to go through this when we can meet at home?

515
00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:01.731
You won't have to carry this around.

516
00:42:01.961 --> 00:42:05.470
Seriously. What kind of a boyfriend never visits his girlfriend's home?

517
00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:08.700
Why do we have to do this here when there's home?

518
00:42:16.281 --> 00:42:19.080
Give me that. I'll dry it for you.

519
00:42:19.281 --> 00:42:20.781
I'm an expert at this.

520
00:42:22.921 --> 00:42:24.191
Do it properly.

521
00:42:24.191 --> 00:42:27.350
I am doing it properly. It's your hair. Look.

522
00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:28.421
Is it a wig?

523
00:42:45.711 --> 00:42:46.910
It's pretty.

524
00:42:50.281 --> 00:42:51.350
Is it?

525
00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:53.450
Yes.

526
00:42:54.981 --> 00:42:56.321
It's really pretty.

527
00:43:03.091 --> 00:43:06.691
But why are you giving me this all of a sudden?

528
00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:10.361
I've been thinking,

529
00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:14.001
and I realized I've never given you a gift.

530
00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:16.341
I didn't even give you a ring when we got married.

531
00:43:16.941 --> 00:43:19.571
That's why I wanted to...

532
00:43:20.071 --> 00:43:21.611
give you something.

533
00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:24.910
I know it's ordinary and boring, but I wanted to do what others do.

534
00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:27.080
Giving you such gifts.

535
00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:30.080
I see.

536
00:43:32.350 --> 00:43:34.961
Is that why you wanted to have

537
00:43:34.961 --> 00:43:37.930
an ordinary and boring date that others do?

538
00:43:38.361 --> 00:43:39.531
Like today?

539
00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:45.470
Well...

540
00:43:48.671 --> 00:43:50.841
I heard you asked Won Seok...

541
00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:53.240
how people date these days.

542
00:43:53.441 --> 00:43:55.810
Yes. I realized...

543
00:43:55.981 --> 00:43:58.651
that you and I have some age gap...

544
00:43:59.211 --> 00:44:01.381
that I didn't know what young people like you do on dates.

545
00:44:02.881 --> 00:44:04.080
I know.

546
00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:08.660
You're quite older than I thought.

547
00:44:09.361 --> 00:44:11.260
You were born in 1980.

548
00:44:11.930 --> 00:44:14.501
That means you were in middle school...

549
00:44:14.961 --> 00:44:16.700
when I started my elementary school.

550
00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:19.200
When I was in my middle school,

551
00:44:20.401 --> 00:44:22.040
you were serving in military.

552
00:44:23.941 --> 00:44:26.470
Well, that's not exactly true.

553
00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:28.810
It was...

554
00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:31.251
just my duty.

555
00:44:33.010 --> 00:44:34.180
Okay.

556
00:44:35.021 --> 00:44:37.381
That's why I also asked...

557
00:44:37.381 --> 00:44:38.890
Mr. Ma.

558
00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:42.560
I asked where I should go for a date with someone old like you.

559
00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:46.731
I heard you came here often when you were in college.

560
00:44:48.731 --> 00:44:49.760
I did.

561
00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:04.651
Aren't you going to order?

562
00:45:05.350 --> 00:45:06.410
What would you like to drink?

563
00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:10.080
I'll have this.

564
00:45:10.450 --> 00:45:12.651
I have to go to the washroom.

565
00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:14.051
I'll order it for you.

566
00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:23.461
I'll go and try this on.

567
00:45:24.271 --> 00:45:25.330
Sure.

568
00:45:37.481 --> 00:45:38.850
How adorable of him.

569
00:45:59.671 --> 00:46:00.901
Thank you.

570
00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:17.151
Let me help you.

571
00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:19.720
I'll give you a hand.

572
00:46:34.970 --> 00:46:35.970
I got it.

573
00:46:49.021 --> 00:46:50.180
Thank you.

574
00:46:51.821 --> 00:46:52.921
It's pretty.

575
00:47:36.302 --> 00:47:37.473
I'm sorry.

576
00:47:38.272 --> 00:47:41.973
It's just that I can see the sky well from this seat.

577
00:47:46.543 --> 00:47:47.783
I'm sorry.

578
00:47:54.822 --> 00:47:56.022
Excuse me.

579
00:48:02.393 --> 00:48:03.933
Goodbye.

580
00:48:06.302 --> 00:48:07.402
Bye.

581
00:48:18.543 --> 00:48:19.882
It's not ready yet?

582
00:48:25.022 --> 00:48:26.322
That suits you.

583
00:48:28.052 --> 00:48:29.152
Right?

584
00:48:30.793 --> 00:48:33.462
Ho Rang, Ji Ho's husband is quite funny isn't he?

585
00:48:33.663 --> 00:48:36.393
How could he do exactly as I told him to?

586
00:48:36.833 --> 00:48:39.563
I know. They looked cute together.

587
00:48:40.402 --> 00:48:43.272
Should we have played that since it's been a long time?

588
00:48:44.072 --> 00:48:45.543
No, it's a waste of money.

589
00:48:45.543 --> 00:48:46.643
Right?

590
00:48:47.002 --> 00:48:48.743
Dolls only take up space.

591
00:48:50.612 --> 00:48:52.283
We ordered too much today too.

592
00:48:53.942 --> 00:48:57.413
Mother bought this for me as a gift for getting a job.

593
00:48:58.022 --> 00:48:59.152
She did?

594
00:49:00.283 --> 00:49:02.652
What did you two talk about?

595
00:49:03.223 --> 00:49:06.563
Well, she said...

596
00:49:06.563 --> 00:49:08.732
You need to be more honest to each other.

597
00:49:08.993 --> 00:49:11.703
Humans are only selfish beings,

598
00:49:11.703 --> 00:49:14.873
and marriage is one of the systems...

599
00:49:15.103 --> 00:49:17.703
that clearly show that side of a human.

600
00:49:20.002 --> 00:49:21.112
Ho Rang.

601
00:49:22.973 --> 00:49:24.683
Could you wait...

602
00:49:27.953 --> 00:49:30.882
- Yes? - some more until we get married?

603
00:49:35.493 --> 00:49:36.623
For how long?

604
00:49:38.263 --> 00:49:39.393
About five years.

605
00:49:43.393 --> 00:49:45.533
- Five years? - Yes.

606
00:49:46.862 --> 00:49:49.302
I think it's going to take that long.

607
00:49:53.543 --> 00:49:57.783
Won Seok, I'll turn 35 after 5 years.

608
00:50:00.513 --> 00:50:03.183
Are you saying we should date for 12 years?

609
00:50:11.763 --> 00:50:12.862
Ho Rang.

610
00:50:13.793 --> 00:50:15.732
Do you want to rest at home if you're tired?

611
00:50:16.033 --> 00:50:18.232
It's okay. You said you reserved it.

612
00:50:26.373 --> 00:50:28.442
(Finding Kim Jong Min)

613
00:50:32.243 --> 00:50:33.342
Let's go.

614
00:50:33.913 --> 00:50:35.112
What's this?

615
00:50:36.353 --> 00:50:38.183
Didn't you reserve for "Finding Kim Jong Wook"?

616
00:50:39.152 --> 00:50:40.552
"Finding Kim Jong Wook?"

617
00:50:42.252 --> 00:50:43.793
Isn't it "Finding Kim Jong Min"?

618
00:50:53.533 --> 00:50:55.502
I didn't know...

619
00:50:56.572 --> 00:50:59.473
there was "Finding Kim Jong Wook".

620
00:50:59.572 --> 00:51:03.313
That's no big deal. I can cancel it and reserve "Finding Kim Jong Wook".

621
00:51:04.072 --> 00:51:06.842
Don't bother. There won't be any tickets left anyway.

622
00:51:07.013 --> 00:51:08.183
Let's just see this.

623
00:51:16.552 --> 00:51:18.422
Have you seen Kim Jong Min?

624
00:51:18.793 --> 00:51:21.132
I heard someone saw him here.

625
00:51:24.362 --> 00:51:25.632
I guess you don't know.

626
00:51:26.163 --> 00:51:27.873
Someone was looking for me?

627
00:51:28.033 --> 00:51:30.103
Where is she? Where did she go?

628
00:51:35.743 --> 00:51:38.513
I guess I came too late again.

629
00:51:40.013 --> 00:51:42.052
Ho Rang, what's wrong with you? Are you insane?

630
00:51:42.052 --> 00:51:43.283
Marry me!

631
00:51:45.152 --> 00:51:49.123
I want to get married already, you fool!

632
00:51:52.462 --> 00:51:57.163
But I still don't get what marriage is all about.

633
00:51:58.533 --> 00:52:01.002
Are marriage and love...

634
00:52:01.772 --> 00:52:03.302
the same thing?

635
00:52:07.243 --> 00:52:10.743
How long is it going to take for me to find her?

636
00:52:11.882 --> 00:52:14.382
It'd be better to be prepared...

637
00:52:14.382 --> 00:52:15.982
even if we're going to get married two years later.

638
00:52:16.783 --> 00:52:21.192
When will I be able to meet him again?

639
00:52:21.723 --> 00:52:23.953
Ho Rang, what are you saying?

640
00:52:24.493 --> 00:52:26.763
How can we get married in two years?

641
00:52:26.763 --> 00:52:29.092
Could you wait some more?

642
00:52:31.302 --> 00:52:32.462
About five years.

643
00:52:34.172 --> 00:52:38.502
Won Seok, I'll turn 35 after 5 years.

644
00:52:39.043 --> 00:52:41.712
Are you saying we should date for 12 years?

645
00:52:43.643 --> 00:52:44.813
How come...

646
00:52:46.982 --> 00:52:48.982
we always miss each other?

647
00:53:17.513 --> 00:53:19.643
Go ahead and wash first.

648
00:53:20.543 --> 00:53:21.652
Pardon?

649
00:53:22.283 --> 00:53:24.382
I should wash first?

650
00:53:24.822 --> 00:53:25.882
Yes.

651
00:53:26.322 --> 00:53:28.252
Since I washed first yesterday,

652
00:53:28.252 --> 00:53:30.893
you should wash first today.

653
00:53:33.322 --> 00:53:35.293
Oh, I guess that's what you meant.

654
00:53:36.333 --> 00:53:38.402
Yes. What's wrong?

655
00:53:39.063 --> 00:53:41.333
Do you have something to tell me?

656
00:53:42.302 --> 00:53:43.402
No.

657
00:53:44.302 --> 00:53:46.743
No, there's nothing else.

658
00:53:46.743 --> 00:53:49.572
What you told me meant to wash up first, not anything else.

659
00:53:53.143 --> 00:53:56.382
You can wash first.

660
00:53:56.913 --> 00:53:59.583
I need to remove my makeup too.

661
00:54:00.853 --> 00:54:03.893
Did you put on a makeup?

662
00:54:05.192 --> 00:54:07.793
Yes. Why do you ask?

663
00:54:08.893 --> 00:54:13.462
Nothing. I thought you don't wear makeup.

664
00:54:14.103 --> 00:54:17.033
You look the same with or without it.

665
00:54:19.572 --> 00:54:23.513
What? You must be kidding. I am wearing makeup.

666
00:54:39.993 --> 00:54:41.293
What was that?

667
00:54:41.592 --> 00:54:44.092
He makes my heart flutter at strange timings.

668
00:54:50.002 --> 00:54:52.842
But until when is that all there will be?

669
00:54:53.842 --> 00:54:58.112
I'm not into platonic love, you old fool.

670
00:55:11.493 --> 00:55:12.663
It's pretty.

671
00:55:14.732 --> 00:55:16.033
What's wrong with me?

672
00:55:16.763 --> 00:55:18.002
Am I insane?

673
00:55:19.232 --> 00:55:21.033
How could I be charmed by a woman?

674
00:55:22.272 --> 00:55:23.703
Am I a pervert?

675
00:55:26.973 --> 00:55:29.112
I'll take you home.

676
00:55:29.672 --> 00:55:30.882
No, thanks.

677
00:55:31.543 --> 00:55:33.882
I want to take you home.

678
00:55:33.942 --> 00:55:36.183
You know underground parking lots are really dangerous.

679
00:55:36.882 --> 00:55:38.422
You're being weirdly stubborn.

680
00:55:39.953 --> 00:55:43.692
Do you have any desire to get married?

681
00:55:44.022 --> 00:55:45.192
Married?

682
00:55:46.223 --> 00:55:47.322
Never.

683
00:55:47.893 --> 00:55:49.563
- Never? - Yes.

684
00:55:50.393 --> 00:55:52.462
Do you ever want to get married?

685
00:55:53.462 --> 00:55:54.873
I'm not into it either.

686
00:55:55.272 --> 00:55:56.373
But then...

687
00:55:56.732 --> 00:55:59.243
I'll do it if I get a chance to marry someone.

688
00:56:00.103 --> 00:56:03.342
But then, having meals together, going grocery shopping together,

689
00:56:04.013 --> 00:56:07.442
arguing with each other, and sharing each other's lives...

690
00:56:08.382 --> 00:56:10.382
don't sound too bad.

691
00:56:10.382 --> 00:56:12.123
That's why I won't get married.

692
00:56:12.552 --> 00:56:15.993
How can I sleep with someone whom I share my pathetic life with?

693
00:56:16.022 --> 00:56:17.123
It'll only break the fantasy.

694
00:56:17.893 --> 00:56:18.962
What?

695
00:56:19.063 --> 00:56:21.833
Marriage is the tomb of a romantic relationship.

696
00:56:21.893 --> 00:56:23.433
It puts an end to their sexual life.

697
00:56:23.763 --> 00:56:26.103
Think about it. How can a man and woman...

698
00:56:26.103 --> 00:56:29.632
sleep together after arguing over their loans and in-laws?

699
00:56:30.333 --> 00:56:32.203
- Am I wrong? - Soo Ji.

700
00:56:33.143 --> 00:56:36.072
That's how people live.

701
00:56:36.413 --> 00:56:39.913
They argue like crazy, but they comfort each other too.

702
00:56:40.513 --> 00:56:42.183
Everyone lives that way.

703
00:56:42.313 --> 00:56:45.623
I don't want to do what everyone else does.

704
00:56:46.252 --> 00:56:47.822
My life is full of trouble as is.

705
00:56:48.152 --> 00:56:50.422
I know very well about my place.

706
00:56:51.723 --> 00:56:53.862
I don't intend to ruin someone else's life as well.

707
00:57:02.302 --> 00:57:05.543
("If You're Having a Sexless Life, Your Health Is in Danger")

708
00:57:11.583 --> 00:57:12.612
Right.

709
00:57:13.043 --> 00:57:16.783
(Firstly, you have insomnia. Secondly, you become sensitive.)

710
00:57:18.683 --> 00:57:20.283
Definitely,

711
00:57:21.652 --> 00:57:23.893
I'm sexually frustrated.

712
00:57:26.022 --> 00:57:27.163
This is bad.

713
00:58:11.802 --> 00:58:13.373
Thanks for the book.

714
00:58:14.973 --> 00:58:18.143
I borrowed it without knowing it was your memories.

715
00:58:20.083 --> 00:58:21.252
I'm sorry.

716
00:58:33.123 --> 00:58:34.893
How will you go home? By bus?

717
00:58:35.092 --> 00:58:38.033
No, I'll take a subway.

718
00:58:38.433 --> 00:58:41.132
I would give you a ride if I didn't have work.

719
00:58:41.833 --> 00:58:44.672
Gosh. No, thank you, Ms. Woo.

720
00:58:46.603 --> 00:58:49.212
I mean, if you feel that bad,

721
00:58:49.272 --> 00:58:51.043
let me have some coffee at your house.

722
00:58:52.442 --> 00:58:55.013
Let's be honest. How can you not even think of...

723
00:58:55.283 --> 00:58:56.853
serving me a cup of coffee when I came all the way here?

724
00:58:57.783 --> 00:58:59.583
So it wasn't out of pure intention.

725
00:58:59.922 --> 00:59:01.623
You're slier than I expected.

726
00:59:01.623 --> 00:59:04.493
I'm not sly. I just want to have...

727
00:59:04.493 --> 00:59:05.993
a glimpse of my girlfriend's house.

728
00:59:06.163 --> 00:59:08.333
I'm curious what your room will smell like.

729
00:59:08.533 --> 00:59:10.433
I'm curious to see your pajamas.

730
00:59:10.663 --> 00:59:13.763
And yes, I'm curious about your dirty toilet.

731
00:59:14.033 --> 00:59:15.802
Why are you curious about such things?

732
00:59:16.672 --> 00:59:18.243
I just can't understand.

733
00:59:18.973 --> 00:59:22.212
I simply want to share each other's daily lives with you.

734
00:59:23.143 --> 00:59:25.212
Go before the subway stops running.

735
00:59:25.612 --> 00:59:27.083
I need to go back to work.

736
00:59:27.612 --> 00:59:30.252
Oh, right. Do you want me to give you some kimchi?

737
00:59:30.283 --> 00:59:32.882
- Ji Ho gave me some. - No, thanks. I quit eating kimchi.

738
00:59:43.692 --> 00:59:45.933
What are you doing over there?

739
00:59:46.533 --> 00:59:48.833
Hey, don't you think your mom's a bit strange?

740
00:59:49.333 --> 00:59:51.342
Did she hide gold in her house or something?

741
00:59:56.743 --> 00:59:59.442
(From: My Love)

742
01:00:02.533 --> 01:00:04.833
Hey, don't you think your mom's a bit strange?

743
01:00:05.333 --> 01:00:07.342
Did she hide gold in her house or something?

744
01:00:12.743 --> 01:00:15.442
(From: My Love)

745
01:00:19.985 --> 01:00:21.456
What are you doing? Let's go.

746
01:00:22.516 --> 01:00:23.615
Okay.

747
01:00:38.436 --> 01:00:41.005
- Go home safely and text me. - Okay.

748
01:00:43.275 --> 01:00:44.675
The doors are closing.

749
01:00:49.945 --> 01:00:51.916
- Soo Ji. - Yes?

750
01:00:52.186 --> 01:00:54.456
Are your friends coming over to your house by any chance?

751
01:00:55.556 --> 01:00:56.655
No.

752
01:00:56.856 --> 01:00:59.226
No one's coming at this hour. They're all busy.

753
01:01:00.996 --> 01:01:02.095
I see.

754
01:01:02.655 --> 01:01:05.425
What? Is it about coffee again?

755
01:01:06.226 --> 01:01:07.695
I'm tired.

756
01:01:07.896 --> 01:01:10.266
I want to take a rest alone at home, okay?

757
01:01:17.306 --> 01:01:18.376
Bye.

758
01:01:18.445 --> 01:01:19.905
The doors are closing.

759
01:01:24.945 --> 01:01:27.516
First of all, we can only meet outside,

760
01:01:27.686 --> 01:01:28.755
whether it's a weekday or not.

761
01:01:28.985 --> 01:01:32.086
Second of all, never ask each other about private lives.

762
01:01:39.595 --> 01:01:40.766
Give me that.

763
01:01:41.036 --> 01:01:43.465
That's mine.

764
01:01:46.465 --> 01:01:47.735
I'm sorry.

765
01:01:47.806 --> 01:01:50.606
I remember most of those men whom I slept with.

766
01:01:52.405 --> 01:01:54.746
I said I wanted to sleep with you, not date.

767
01:01:55.516 --> 01:01:58.215
I was just fooling around with you...

768
01:01:58.715 --> 01:01:59.985
because I wanted to sleep with someone.

769
01:02:01.615 --> 01:02:04.286
Marriage? I'd never get married.

770
01:02:07.325 --> 01:02:08.556
You're out.

771
01:03:03.646 --> 01:03:08.885
(Don't ever love someone. You don't have the right to love.)

772
01:03:15.925 --> 01:03:17.566
It's cold. Why are you outside?

773
01:03:17.766 --> 01:03:21.166
I went to a market to buy some ingredients and make soup.

774
01:03:21.465 --> 01:03:23.095
It's cold. Let's go inside, Mom.

775
01:03:26.566 --> 01:03:27.836
You're not skipping meals, are you?

776
01:03:28.936 --> 01:03:30.806
I haven't had dinner yet so I can have it with you.

777
01:03:41.356 --> 01:03:42.856
"Meeting someone in life is..."

778
01:03:44.115 --> 01:03:46.686
"actually something astonishing."

779
01:04:08.175 --> 01:04:11.385
"That's because..."

780
01:04:12.146 --> 01:04:14.816
"he brings himself with..."

781
01:04:19.155 --> 01:04:20.456
"his past, his present,"

782
01:04:21.655 --> 01:04:23.295
"and his future."

783
01:04:33.005 --> 01:04:34.135
Let's go.

784
01:04:35.275 --> 01:04:36.376
Ho Rang.

785
01:04:37.275 --> 01:04:38.445
Yes?

786
01:04:41.175 --> 01:04:42.316
What is it?

787
01:04:45.345 --> 01:04:46.646
Let's break up.

788
01:04:50.016 --> 01:04:52.956
"That's because someone's whole life..."

789
01:04:53.985 --> 01:04:55.396
"comes along."

790
01:04:56.155 --> 01:04:58.425
(Don't ever love someone. You don't have the right to love.)

791
01:05:07.106 --> 01:05:08.275
Jung Min.

792
01:05:11.206 --> 01:05:14.146
I took my things out.

793
01:05:15.045 --> 01:05:16.675
You can just take yours.

794
01:05:18.246 --> 01:05:19.416
I'm...

795
01:05:20.856 --> 01:05:22.985
I'm sorry. Let me explain everything.

796
01:05:23.255 --> 01:05:25.686
- Dad called me... - Don't say...

797
01:05:28.226 --> 01:05:30.195
anything about your dad to me.

798
01:05:33.295 --> 01:05:34.795
Don't tell me...

799
01:05:38.266 --> 01:05:40.005
anything about...

800
01:05:42.606 --> 01:05:43.735
your family.

801
01:05:46.206 --> 01:05:47.345
Can we...

802
01:05:48.945 --> 01:05:50.985
please talk about it?

803
01:05:50.985 --> 01:05:52.416
Don't say...

804
01:05:54.916 --> 01:05:56.385
"Us" to me.

805
01:06:02.325 --> 01:06:03.825
I don't want you to be happy.

806
01:06:19.946 --> 01:06:21.375
(Don't ever love someone. You don't have the right to love.)

807
01:06:21.375 --> 01:06:22.715
As you told me,

808
01:06:24.186 --> 01:06:26.085
I wasn't happy for a while.

809
01:06:31.425 --> 01:06:32.686
As you told me,

810
01:06:34.156 --> 01:06:37.425
I didn't love anyone for a while.

811
01:06:39.995 --> 01:06:43.335
But today,

812
01:06:44.766 --> 01:06:46.005
briefly,

813
01:06:50.505 --> 01:06:51.906
I was happy.

814
01:06:53.106 --> 01:06:54.345
Briefly,

815
01:06:55.316 --> 01:06:58.585
I forgot about everything.

816
01:07:05.656 --> 01:07:08.026
Do you want to watch it with me?

817
01:07:25.146 --> 01:07:26.646
I do...

818
01:07:28.946 --> 01:07:30.146
adore this woman.

819
01:07:39.425 --> 01:07:40.785
What she thinks is...

820
01:07:42.026 --> 01:07:43.226
cute.

821
01:07:45.196 --> 01:07:46.396
However...

822
01:07:54.375 --> 01:07:57.436
Goodnight.

823
01:07:58.375 --> 01:07:59.576
Yes.

824
01:08:00.545 --> 01:08:01.816
Goodnight.

825
01:08:09.056 --> 01:08:10.556
At the same time,

826
01:08:12.026 --> 01:08:13.486
I'm afraid of myself.

827
01:08:15.295 --> 01:08:18.226
I'm scared of myself...

828
01:08:20.026 --> 01:08:21.696
for hurting someone...

829
01:08:23.696 --> 01:08:25.436
again.

830
01:08:30.035 --> 01:08:31.205
But...

831
01:08:35.816 --> 01:08:37.076
Now...

832
01:08:41.156 --> 01:08:42.356
Do you want to...

833
01:08:43.785 --> 01:08:44.955
sleep with me...

834
01:08:50.356 --> 01:08:51.566
tonight?

835
01:08:57.965 --> 01:08:59.635
I want to be happy.

836
01:09:19.625 --> 01:09:23.396
(Because This Is My First Life)

837
01:09:24.566 --> 01:09:26.495
Was it uncomfortable for you?

838
01:09:27.465 --> 01:09:30.795
If you love someone, there are more things you should care about.

839
01:09:31.236 --> 01:09:32.965
I like that relationship.

840
01:09:34.606 --> 01:09:38.345
A CEO from a production company came to see me today.

841
01:09:39.045 --> 01:09:41.976
Did you hear anything about her since then?

842
01:09:42.646 --> 01:09:44.715
Is this how you being with someone...

843
01:09:44.715 --> 01:09:47.915
invading the part of my life that I don't want to show you?

844
01:09:48.056 --> 01:09:51.556
I want to make a good story that I can share.

845
01:09:51.556 --> 01:09:53.925
I experienced something similar to marriage.

846
01:09:54.295 --> 01:09:58.925
He and I have an understanding.
