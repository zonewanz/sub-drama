00:00:06.092 --> 00:00:10.230
(Jincheon National Training Center, a new home for national athletes)

2
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.860
- Hello. - Hi.

3
00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:14.930
What are those? I see blue and red flags.

4
00:00:14.934 --> 00:00:17.970
(There are pink and blue flags that match their team uniform.)

5
00:00:18.672 --> 00:00:20.470
We already split into teams from the start.

6
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.910
I've had the same team members for a while now.

7
00:00:24.477 --> 00:00:26.680
- That's true. - I wanted you to bond...

8
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.150
- with your teams before your trip. - I see.

9
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.550
- He was preparing us. - How nice of him.

10
00:00:31.551 --> 00:00:34.320
Does that mean Anyang Hothead is going to be the leader of the team?

11
00:00:34.321 --> 00:00:36.150
- Anyang Hothead? - He's already fussy.

12
00:00:36.156 --> 00:00:38.790
- He's going to make a fuss. - Right. It's going to be my team.

13
00:00:38.792 --> 00:00:42.190
All of the members in my team are known to be hotheads.

14
00:00:42.195 --> 00:00:43.630
I'm sure you know how Ji Hyo gets.

15
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.660
- Of course. She's a hothead too. - This is Ji Hyo, the hothead.

16
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:47.730
My goodness.

17
00:00:47.734 --> 00:00:51.370
Everyone, this is a new training center for our national teams.

18
00:00:51.371 --> 00:00:53.100
I saw this on the news.

19
00:00:53.106 --> 00:00:55.200
- It looked really nice. - I didn't know how big this was.

20
00:00:55.208 --> 00:00:57.710
(The center opened in September and can hold 1,150 athletes.)

21
00:00:57.711 --> 00:01:01.980
So you'll form two teams of athletes and compete against each other.

22
00:01:01.981 --> 00:01:03.380
I'm sorry. We're athletes?

23
00:01:03.383 --> 00:01:04.750
- This isn't good. - I like it.

24
00:01:04.751 --> 00:01:08.150
- Jong Kook is the only athlete. - I love today's theme.

25
00:01:08.154 --> 00:01:10.050
Seok Jin forgot his cane in the car.

26
00:01:10.056 --> 00:01:11.920
- His legs are getting weaker. - Look at you.

27
00:01:11.925 --> 00:01:14.260
- He needs to go get it. I mean... - Hey.

28
00:01:14.461 --> 00:01:17.930
Seok Jin, instead of trying to look young with your outfits, work out.

29
00:01:17.931 --> 00:01:19.830
This is recommended by our country.

30
00:01:19.833 --> 00:01:21.630
- What is that? - Work out three times a week...

31
00:01:21.801 --> 00:01:23.060
- 3 times? - for 30 minutes.

32
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.170
So it's called 7-3-30 Exercise. Work out 3 times a week.

33
00:01:26.172 --> 00:01:27.770
- 3 times a week? - Just invest 30 minutes.

34
00:01:27.807 --> 00:01:30.840
But I know that Seok Jin lies down every day...

35
00:01:31.378 --> 00:01:33.040
for more than 30 minutes.

36
00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.310
- He does. - I'm good at lying down.

37
00:01:35.315 --> 00:01:37.180
Look at Seok Jin.

38
00:01:37.317 --> 00:01:39.750
Seok Jin, you're going to pop your knees.

39
00:01:40.186 --> 00:01:41.880
- Don't overwork yourself. - Stick out your bottom more.

40
00:01:41.888 --> 00:01:43.690
- More? - Your knees can't go past the toes.

41
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.820
- I see. - You didn't have to correct him.

42
00:01:45.825 --> 00:01:47.490
- He was doing it wrong. - He could have just let that go.

43
00:01:47.494 --> 00:01:49.790
- What's wrong with helping him? - I was just helping him out.

44
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.560
You'll be competing against each other as two teams of athletes.

45
00:01:55.635 --> 00:01:58.200
Are there any sports teams you'd like to be part of before we begin?

46
00:01:58.204 --> 00:01:59.900
(Sports team we want to be part of?)

47
00:01:59.906 --> 00:02:02.200
- Sports team? - Hey, let's choose a cool one.

48
00:02:02.208 --> 00:02:03.710
- Like what? - I like to be in a baseball team.

49
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:04.770
That's pretty cool.

50
00:02:04.778 --> 00:02:06.370
- Let's choose the baseball team. - Baseball team.

51
00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:07.380
It's cool.

52
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.380
(They're smirking.)

53
00:02:08.381 --> 00:02:10.280
- Baseball team? - You'll be the baseball team?

54
00:02:10.283 --> 00:02:11.850
- Unbelievable. - Why? It's cool.

55
00:02:11.851 --> 00:02:13.820
- Let's choose the basketball team. - I can't believe they said that.

56
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.790
- Hey, you should choose gateball. - Seok Jin. Choose gateball.

57
00:02:17.791 --> 00:02:19.020
- That suits you. - You.

58
00:02:19.025 --> 00:02:20.260
What is it? Just go with gateball.

59
00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.620
- Hey, you're asking for it. - No one feels intimidated by him.

60
00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:23.890
Hey, calm down.

61
00:02:24.697 --> 00:02:25.930
How about swimming team?

62
00:02:26.466 --> 00:02:29.100
- Swimming team? - Hey, think about your physiques.

63
00:02:29.102 --> 00:02:30.200
What?

64
00:02:31.204 --> 00:02:33.570
- You'll sink with your biceps. - You're hilarious.

65
00:02:33.573 --> 00:02:35.140
Shouldn't you guys be in a fitness team?

66
00:02:35.141 --> 00:02:36.910
- There's no such team. - Fitness team?

67
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.810
Hey, you guys should form a team of hares and tortoises.

68
00:02:38.812 --> 00:02:41.010
(I recommend forming a team of hares and tortoises.)

69
00:02:41.014 --> 00:02:42.510
What on earth are you saying?

70
00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:45.550
It fits you. He could be the tortoise.

71
00:02:45.552 --> 00:02:46.550
(Jong Kook is a tortoise.)

72
00:02:46.553 --> 00:02:48.680
- A team of hares and tortoises. - Should we be a team of big noses?

73
00:02:48.721 --> 00:02:49.880
Should we be a team of big noses?

74
00:02:50.557 --> 00:02:51.790
- Big noses? - Our noses are big.

75
00:02:51.791 --> 00:02:53.920
- That's a horrible idea. - Seok Jin's nose is big.

76
00:02:53.927 --> 00:02:55.290
- You should go with that. - Big noses?

77
00:02:55.295 --> 00:02:57.160
- We'll be Team Hare and Tortoise. - You should be Team Big Nose then.

78
00:02:57.163 --> 00:02:58.160
We'll do it if you agree.

79
00:02:58.164 --> 00:02:59.960
- Fine. We accept. - We'll do it.

80
00:02:59.966 --> 00:03:01.700
- You're Team Big Nose. - You're Team Hare and Tortoise.

81
00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:04.070
Why are you drawing blackheads on it?

82
00:03:04.804 --> 00:03:05.900
- Is that our nose? - Yes.

83
00:03:05.905 --> 00:03:07.300
Is this a nose or poop?

84
00:03:07.307 --> 00:03:08.440
That's a nose.

85
00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:10.640
(Is that a fly sitting on top?)

86
00:03:10.643 --> 00:03:12.110
- Hey! There's fly there. - So Min.

87
00:03:12.111 --> 00:03:13.740
This looks like poop.

88
00:03:14.214 --> 00:03:15.710
This is a drawing of poop.

89
00:03:16.516 --> 00:03:17.710
That looks like a slipper.

90
00:03:17.717 --> 00:03:18.980
(They're done choosing their names.)

91
00:03:19.385 --> 00:03:22.580
- Before you start competing, - My goodness.

92
00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:24.890
we'll bring in the hardboard panel.

93
00:03:25.558 --> 00:03:26.720
- What is that? - What is it?

94
00:03:27.026 --> 00:03:29.290
"Course menu depending on the get-together money". A get-together?

95
00:03:29.295 --> 00:03:30.390
"Korean beef party".

96
00:03:31.164 --> 00:03:32.190
Snack food isn't bad.

97
00:03:32.198 --> 00:03:33.760
- Snack food isn't bad. - There will be ramyeon.

98
00:03:33.766 --> 00:03:35.000
- There will be tteokbokki. - Today,

99
00:03:35.001 --> 00:03:37.600
we prepared the Race for Get-together Money...

100
00:03:37.604 --> 00:03:40.500
- for the members of Running Man. - Okay!

101
00:03:41.341 --> 00:03:42.500
That sounds fun.

102
00:03:42.742 --> 00:03:46.110
Each team will get 60 dollars of get-together money.

103
00:03:46.112 --> 00:03:49.210
The winning team of each round will have the right...

104
00:03:49.215 --> 00:03:51.910
to take the other team's get-together money.

105
00:03:51.918 --> 00:03:54.120
The team with more money in the end will win.

106
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.550
Only the winning team will be provided with the menu...

107
00:03:56.556 --> 00:03:58.890
that matches the amount of money. Please give it your best.

108
00:03:58.892 --> 00:04:00.520
- Okay. - Okay.

109
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:01.990
Let's eat beef.

110
00:04:02.495 --> 00:04:03.860
Before we get started,

111
00:04:04.364 --> 00:04:06.530
we would like to introduce the new members.

112
00:04:07.267 --> 00:04:09.160
They must be good at sports.

113
00:04:09.302 --> 00:04:10.730
Then they must be cool.

114
00:04:10.737 --> 00:04:12.270
- I miss Kang Daniel. - Daniel.

115
00:04:15.308 --> 00:04:17.040
- This is... - This is "Sorry Sorry".

116
00:04:17.143 --> 00:04:18.310
Super Junior.

117
00:04:18.311 --> 00:04:19.540
(It's "Sorry Sorry" by Super Junior.)

118
00:04:19.546 --> 00:04:20.940
- This is "Sorry Sorry". - Super Junior.

119
00:04:20.947 --> 00:04:22.010
Super Junior.

120
00:04:22.015 --> 00:04:23.440
- Super Junior is here. - Super Junior is here.

121
00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:26.050
- Super Junior is here. - Eun Hyuk, Ye Sung,

122
00:04:26.452 --> 00:04:27.980
and Dong Hae. It has been a while.

123
00:04:28.588 --> 00:04:30.390
(Eun Hyuk was discharged from the army 3 months ago.)

124
00:04:31.324 --> 00:04:33.250
- My goodness. - Welcome.

125
00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:34.390
Hello.

126
00:04:34.394 --> 00:04:36.060
- My goodness. - It's Ye Sung.

127
00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:38.360
- Dong Hae. - Hello.

128
00:04:39.032 --> 00:04:40.360
Give them a big hand.

129
00:04:41.334 --> 00:04:43.200
- We are Super Junior. - We are Super Junior.

130
00:04:43.202 --> 00:04:45.300
(We are the new members, Super Junior.)

131
00:04:45.905 --> 00:04:49.200
Eun Hyuk and So Min are alumni.

132
00:04:49.208 --> 00:04:50.340
(We are alumni from elementary and middle schools.)

133
00:04:50.343 --> 00:04:51.340
- That's right. - Really?

134
00:04:51.344 --> 00:04:53.010
- They really are alumni. - She has talked about it.

135
00:04:53.012 --> 00:04:54.210
- They really are alumni. - Elementary and middle schools.

136
00:04:54.213 --> 00:04:55.480
Are you alumni?

137
00:04:57.083 --> 00:05:00.480
(Their friendship goes back 20 years to Neunggok.)

138
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.680
(The 9-year friendship from their school days continues.)

139
00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:04.950
- They really are alumni. - She has talked about it.

140
00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:05.950
- They really are alumni. - Elementary and middle schools.

141
00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:08.020
- Are you alumni? - Eun Hyuk told us that...

142
00:05:08.027 --> 00:05:09.760
So Min liked him back in school.

143
00:05:09.762 --> 00:05:11.490
What are you talking about?

144
00:05:12.198 --> 00:05:14.760
- What are you talking about? - Did you like him?

145
00:05:14.767 --> 00:05:16.760
- For goodness' sake, So Min. - She likes everyone.

146
00:05:16.769 --> 00:05:18.630
- She likes everyone. - I heard Eun Hyuk was popular.

147
00:05:18.638 --> 00:05:19.830
- He was very popular. - That's right.

148
00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:21.840
What was she like back in elementary school?

149
00:05:21.841 --> 00:05:24.010
- She has always been that way. - Always?

150
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.740
Did she have a nickname?

151
00:05:26.212 --> 00:05:28.010
In elementary school, the nicknames were based on names.

152
00:05:28.014 --> 00:05:29.480
That's right.

153
00:05:29.882 --> 00:05:31.080
However, this is a bit...

154
00:05:31.084 --> 00:05:33.110
- Wouldn't it be okay? - I think I know what it is.

155
00:05:33.152 --> 00:05:35.980
- What is it? - It used to be Jeon Cow Poop.

156
00:05:36.022 --> 00:05:39.090
- Poop? - From Cow Poop,

157
00:05:39.092 --> 00:05:40.560
the nickname became Milk Cow Poop.

158
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:41.760
Hyuk Jae...

159
00:05:41.761 --> 00:05:43.520
- had a nickname, too. - What was it?

160
00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:44.530
- Hyuk Jae? - Hyuk Jae.

161
00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:45.960
Are you attacking him with his real name?

162
00:05:45.965 --> 00:05:47.530
In elementary school, we teased each other like that.

163
00:05:47.533 --> 00:05:49.700
It's understandable. You were children.

164
00:05:49.702 --> 00:05:54.840
They are close. So Min wasn't lying.

165
00:05:54.841 --> 00:05:55.940
We were in the same homeroom in fourth grade.

166
00:05:55.942 --> 00:05:57.510
- Teuk. - Yes?

167
00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.340
You don't look very happy to listen to the stories...

168
00:06:01.347 --> 00:06:02.980
they share.

169
00:06:03.282 --> 00:06:05.880
- It's an unexpected situation. - That's right.

170
00:06:05.885 --> 00:06:07.580
You become flustered in unexpected situations.

171
00:06:07.587 --> 00:06:09.180
He keeps sighing.

172
00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:11.550
I didn't know Running Man was this kind of a program.

173
00:06:13.192 --> 00:06:15.820
We need to hear from Super Junior since it has been a while.

174
00:06:15.828 --> 00:06:17.260
Your hairstyle...

175
00:06:17.263 --> 00:06:19.290
Isn't it too much of a Shinjuku style?

176
00:06:20.266 --> 00:06:22.000
(Shinjuku style)

177
00:06:22.001 --> 00:06:23.660
I feel like I am in Shinjuku.

178
00:06:23.703 --> 00:06:26.070
I am sorry. I really wanted to say it.

179
00:06:26.072 --> 00:06:27.200
It's too Shinjuku.

180
00:06:27.206 --> 00:06:29.000
- Harajuku. - Harajuku.

181
00:06:29.008 --> 00:06:30.140
It's Harajuku.

182
00:06:30.143 --> 00:06:31.740
I really wanted to say it.

183
00:06:32.512 --> 00:06:34.010
Don't you think...

184
00:06:34.013 --> 00:06:36.880
your teeth are too white?

185
00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.310
- I brushed my teeth diligently. - Is that why?

186
00:06:39.318 --> 00:06:40.520
- Really? - Yes.

187
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.050
Your lips are too red, too.

188
00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:44.890
Your overall look is too artificial.

189
00:06:45.825 --> 00:06:47.390
(It's a combination of artificiality.)

190
00:06:47.393 --> 00:06:48.620
He tried too hard.

191
00:06:48.895 --> 00:06:50.460
Perhaps, it was on purpose.

192
00:06:50.463 --> 00:06:52.960
These looks don't stand out in the studio.

193
00:06:52.965 --> 00:06:55.130
- You're right. - But it's different outside.

194
00:06:55.134 --> 00:06:57.100
I hadn't had many shoots outside.

195
00:06:57.403 --> 00:07:01.140
I am so embarrassed. What should I do?

196
00:07:01.841 --> 00:07:03.140
This is nice.

197
00:07:03.142 --> 00:07:04.440
Dong Hae's looks rival Teuk's.

198
00:07:04.444 --> 00:07:06.070
- This is... - Dong Hae always looks that way.

199
00:07:06.079 --> 00:07:07.080
- His looks are natural. - He looks like an actor.

200
00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.510
He looks like an actor from Hong Kong.

201
00:07:08.514 --> 00:07:10.340
He really looks like an actor from Hong Kong.

202
00:07:10.349 --> 00:07:11.950
(His hairstyle makes him look so.)

203
00:07:11.951 --> 00:07:13.680
It looks like he was hit with a typhoon.

204
00:07:14.887 --> 00:07:17.190
(Dong Hae needs to watch out for strong wind.)

205
00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.190
To be honest,

206
00:07:18.191 --> 00:07:19.650
when he runs outside in summer with this hairstyle,

207
00:07:19.659 --> 00:07:23.290
mayflies will get on his hair.

208
00:07:23.596 --> 00:07:25.130
That'll happen today.

209
00:07:26.132 --> 00:07:29.000
Meet the new female members before you go on with the interview.

210
00:07:29.001 --> 00:07:31.400
- Are there new female members? - You should have told us.

211
00:07:31.404 --> 00:07:34.370
- You should have told us. - You should have told us sooner.

212
00:07:35.641 --> 00:07:36.770
(I recognize this song.)

213
00:07:36.776 --> 00:07:38.040
Red Velvet!

214
00:07:38.277 --> 00:07:39.440
Red Velvet!

215
00:07:39.645 --> 00:07:42.080
Irene and Joy.

216
00:07:42.081 --> 00:07:43.480
My goodness, they are here.

217
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:46.150
They are Red Velvet!

218
00:07:46.152 --> 00:07:50.420
(The beautiful rookie, Irene, and the fruit-like girl, Joy)

219
00:07:50.656 --> 00:07:52.250
You are reunited with Kwang Soo after a long time.

220
00:07:52.258 --> 00:07:54.590
- We were in the Couple Race. - You were a couple.

221
00:07:54.594 --> 00:07:55.590
(Kwang Soo and Joy were a couple 2 years ago.)

222
00:07:55.595 --> 00:07:56.890
As you can see, Joy...

223
00:07:56.896 --> 00:08:01.060
(Joy approached Kwang Soo first.)

224
00:08:01.768 --> 00:08:04.830
(The Couple Race gave him happy memories.)

225
00:08:04.837 --> 00:08:06.500
I could feel her sincerity.

226
00:08:07.206 --> 00:08:10.000
My heart remains the same.

227
00:08:10.009 --> 00:08:11.270
However,

228
00:08:11.277 --> 00:08:15.110
I saw him flirt with other women on TV.

229
00:08:15.448 --> 00:08:16.880
He did that a lot in the past two years.

230
00:08:16.883 --> 00:08:18.510
- He is an expert. - He must have done it 60 times.

231
00:08:18.518 --> 00:08:20.050
- That's why... - That's not true.

232
00:08:20.253 --> 00:08:22.820
I feel like I am on the hook.

233
00:08:22.822 --> 00:08:25.190
Joy is ridiculous.

234
00:08:25.191 --> 00:08:27.190
Wasn't she on "We Got Married"?

235
00:08:27.827 --> 00:08:29.520
- Stop it already. - She was on it with Yuk Seong Jae.

236
00:08:29.529 --> 00:08:31.090
- That's right. - Stop it already.

237
00:08:31.097 --> 00:08:32.460
Why would you mention that?

238
00:08:32.465 --> 00:08:34.900
- Joy was opening up. - I was just...

239
00:08:34.901 --> 00:08:36.730
Why would you talk about Yuk Seong Jae?

240
00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:38.770
- Joy. - Yes?

241
00:08:38.771 --> 00:08:41.370
You were on "We Got Married",

242
00:08:41.808 --> 00:08:44.640
but it's not an SBS program.

243
00:08:44.644 --> 00:08:47.010
At least she flirted with one man.

244
00:08:47.013 --> 00:08:49.280
- Kwang Soo did it with all women. - That's right.

245
00:08:49.282 --> 00:08:52.380
Irene, it has been a while.

246
00:08:52.385 --> 00:08:53.550
- The thing is, - She is very pretty.

247
00:08:53.553 --> 00:08:57.120
we were sad to see you leave after a short meeting at the sauna.

248
00:08:57.757 --> 00:09:00.660
Irene was in a commercial for a game.

249
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.260
- That's right. - It was really cute.

250
00:09:02.261 --> 00:09:04.430
She should do something similar for Running Man.

251
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:06.990
Teuk is helping us host the program.

252
00:09:06.999 --> 00:09:08.630
You should go, "Running Man!"

253
00:09:08.634 --> 00:09:11.370
- Stop hosting the program. - I am in the middle.

254
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:14.340
It's like the Hairdresser Special of "Star King".

255
00:09:15.908 --> 00:09:17.100
(The hairdresser can't stop hosting the program.)

256
00:09:17.109 --> 00:09:18.810
The Hairdresser Special.

257
00:09:18.911 --> 00:09:20.740
- My goodness. - "Edward Scissorhands".

258
00:09:20.813 --> 00:09:22.410
I need to interview Irene.

259
00:09:22.415 --> 00:09:24.150
- All right. - Please wait.

260
00:09:24.183 --> 00:09:25.880
- Thank you very much. - All right.

261
00:09:25.985 --> 00:09:27.110
Okay.

262
00:09:27.153 --> 00:09:28.280
It's "Star King".

263
00:09:28.287 --> 00:09:30.850
Irene, would you show us what you did...

264
00:09:30.857 --> 00:09:32.220
on that game commercial?

265
00:09:34.493 --> 00:09:35.590
Honey,

266
00:09:35.795 --> 00:09:38.030
which game do you want to play with me?

267
00:09:39.899 --> 00:09:42.100
(She suddenly becomes haughty and elegant.)

268
00:09:42.134 --> 00:09:43.900
In that case, So Min will first show...

269
00:09:43.903 --> 00:09:45.870
a gamjatang commercial.

270
00:09:47.506 --> 00:09:48.970
Show us. Come on.

271
00:09:48.975 --> 00:09:50.140
My goodness.

272
00:09:50.142 --> 00:09:51.270
She looked graceful in it.

273
00:09:51.277 --> 00:09:53.740
So Min looked elegant in it.

274
00:09:53.746 --> 00:09:55.280
She made gamjatang in a graceful way.

275
00:09:55.281 --> 00:09:56.610
You don't need to be intimidated.

276
00:09:56.616 --> 00:09:58.280
- There she goes. - There she goes.

277
00:09:58.284 --> 00:09:59.750
She is deboning the meat.

278
00:09:59.785 --> 00:10:01.150
- She looks graceful. - She is tasting the soup.

279
00:10:01.153 --> 00:10:02.780
- It tastes refreshing. - Then comes the line.

280
00:10:02.788 --> 00:10:04.120
(My goodness.)

281
00:10:05.124 --> 00:10:06.490
What was the line?

282
00:10:06.626 --> 00:10:08.320
How would I know?

283
00:10:08.761 --> 00:10:10.620
- What was it? - You are the model of the brand.

284
00:10:10.863 --> 00:10:13.090
She sounds like Kim Hye Ja.

285
00:10:13.232 --> 00:10:14.860
Gamjatang.

286
00:10:17.136 --> 00:10:18.770
You shouldn't have mentioned the name.

287
00:10:19.071 --> 00:10:20.270
Did you see that?

288
00:10:20.273 --> 00:10:22.640
Irene, would you reenact the commercial?

289
00:10:22.642 --> 00:10:23.870
Here she goes.

290
00:10:24.777 --> 00:10:26.140
Running Man.

291
00:10:26.679 --> 00:10:27.740
(Laughing)

292
00:10:27.747 --> 00:10:29.310
Why are you laughing? This is what I did.

293
00:10:29.315 --> 00:10:30.880
You are the one who laughed.

294
00:10:31.884 --> 00:10:34.380
(She blames the others for laughing when she laughed alone.)

295
00:10:34.387 --> 00:10:36.880
After laughing alone, she asks, "Why are you laughing?"

296
00:10:36.889 --> 00:10:38.650
- I didn't even know it had ended. - We didn't laugh.

297
00:10:38.891 --> 00:10:40.250
Excuse me.

298
00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.160
I am sorry.

299
00:10:42.295 --> 00:10:43.960
- The thing is... - What was that?

300
00:10:43.996 --> 00:10:46.030
- I am sorry. - The thing is...

301
00:10:48.067 --> 00:10:49.400
- What was that? - Nothing.

302
00:10:49.402 --> 00:10:50.770
I thought he was going to hit her.

303
00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:52.500
- What were you going to do? - Nothing.

304
00:10:52.571 --> 00:10:54.240
It's nothing.

305
00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.840
It looked like he wanted to add a comment.

306
00:10:55.841 --> 00:10:58.140
- Like I said... - He was holding a camera.

307
00:10:58.744 --> 00:11:00.470
He has a camera.

308
00:11:00.479 --> 00:11:02.180
Let it go. Don't worry about it.

309
00:11:02.181 --> 00:11:03.910
- Go ahead, and do it. - Don't worry about it!

310
00:11:03.916 --> 00:11:04.980
I am curious.

311
00:11:04.984 --> 00:11:07.110
- It's not a disposable camera. - I am very curious.

312
00:11:07.119 --> 00:11:08.380
You didn't see anything.

313
00:11:08.387 --> 00:11:10.650
- You didn't see anything. - Don't pay attention to me.

314
00:11:10.656 --> 00:11:11.790
Let it go.

315
00:11:11.791 --> 00:11:13.020
Dong Hae is crying!

316
00:11:13.025 --> 00:11:15.360
- Why did you pester him? - Dong Hae is crying.

317
00:11:15.361 --> 00:11:16.490
Do it when you want to.

318
00:11:16.495 --> 00:11:17.890
- Dong Hae missed his timing. - Don't do it.

319
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:20.800
- We didn't see anything. - Don't do it.

320
00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.760
We don't know what Dong Hae tried to do, but...

321
00:11:24.503 --> 00:11:26.330
(The sun is bright.)

322
00:11:26.639 --> 00:11:27.770
- Dong Hae. - Yes?

323
00:11:27.773 --> 00:11:29.470
Are you posing?

324
00:11:30.142 --> 00:11:31.170
(Teasing)

325
00:11:31.177 --> 00:11:33.270
- People don't pose like this. - Is this a study on Dong Hae?

326
00:11:33.279 --> 00:11:34.410
My goodness.

327
00:11:36.515 --> 00:11:39.380
(I must take a picture of you.)

328
00:11:39.385 --> 00:11:40.750
- That was what he wanted to do. - What was that?

329
00:11:41.387 --> 00:11:42.750
- What was that? - What was that?

330
00:11:42.888 --> 00:11:44.150
That was what he wanted to do.

331
00:11:44.223 --> 00:11:45.720
- What was that? - What was that?

332
00:11:45.725 --> 00:11:47.660
- What was that? - Why did he do that?

333
00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:50.860
He wanted to capture the moment.

334
00:11:51.297 --> 00:11:53.260
- Okay. - Does it have film?

335
00:11:53.265 --> 00:11:55.000
He doesn't use a digital camera.

336
00:11:55.001 --> 00:11:56.000
No.

337
00:11:56.002 --> 00:11:59.230
(He wants to remember the day with a disposable camera.)

338
00:11:59.638 --> 00:12:02.000
The new members are here.

339
00:12:02.141 --> 00:12:04.270
Before you recruit them,

340
00:12:04.276 --> 00:12:06.010
you will get to know them better...

341
00:12:06.012 --> 00:12:08.510
- with 3 and 3 Interview. - I see.

342
00:12:08.547 --> 00:12:11.010
The two teams will take turns to ask...

343
00:12:11.017 --> 00:12:13.080
three yes or no questions.

344
00:12:13.185 --> 00:12:16.020
If the new members' answers are 3 yes and 3 no,

345
00:12:16.022 --> 00:12:17.850
it's a success.

346
00:12:18.124 --> 00:12:21.390
The team that asked the question will get additional 10 dollars.

347
00:12:21.394 --> 00:12:23.760
If their answers to our question...

348
00:12:23.763 --> 00:12:26.130
- are 3 yes and 3 no, - 3 yes and 3 no.

349
00:12:26.132 --> 00:12:27.230
it's a success.

350
00:12:27.233 --> 00:12:31.030
You must ask an original question that wasn't asked on TV.

351
00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:33.530
If the new members think the question is unoriginal,

352
00:12:33.539 --> 00:12:36.600
they can put a dot on the questioner.

353
00:12:36.776 --> 00:12:37.810
Okay.

354
00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:38.970
(They can put a dot on the questioner.)

355
00:12:40.279 --> 00:12:42.110
(Jong Kook of Team Hare and Tortoise begins.)

356
00:12:42.114 --> 00:12:43.240
When I met...

357
00:12:43.616 --> 00:12:45.780
the members of my group, I thought to myself,

358
00:12:47.186 --> 00:12:48.720
"How did they get picked?"

359
00:12:48.721 --> 00:12:52.290
(I thought to myself, "How did they get picked?")

360
00:12:52.291 --> 00:12:53.790
- "How did they get picked?" - My goodness.

361
00:12:53.793 --> 00:12:55.120
Is the thought based on looks?

362
00:12:55.127 --> 00:12:57.390
- What an original question! - It's possible to think that way.

363
00:12:57.396 --> 00:12:58.660
Wait a minute.

364
00:12:58.664 --> 00:13:00.060
Was this question...

365
00:13:00.066 --> 00:13:02.530
approved by the team members? Did you decide on your own?

366
00:13:02.535 --> 00:13:04.470
Even if he decides on his own, we agree.

367
00:13:04.637 --> 00:13:06.230
It works that way in our team.

368
00:13:06.238 --> 00:13:07.970
- Don't worry about that. - Are you...

369
00:13:07.973 --> 00:13:10.100
- Are you really a team? - We are a team.

370
00:13:10.109 --> 00:13:12.010
Haven't you thought about resisting?

371
00:13:12.011 --> 00:13:13.670
My fists are clenched,

372
00:13:13.679 --> 00:13:15.110
but I don't dare swing them.

373
00:13:15.748 --> 00:13:17.680
You would think they would have a coup.

374
00:13:17.683 --> 00:13:19.510
There should be a coup...

375
00:13:19.518 --> 00:13:21.380
so that I can crush them completely.

376
00:13:22.655 --> 00:13:25.050
Then they won't voice...

377
00:13:25.057 --> 00:13:26.620
- any complaints. - He is scary.

378
00:13:27.026 --> 00:13:28.360
(Trembling)

379
00:13:28.894 --> 00:13:30.620
Now...

380
00:13:30.629 --> 00:13:33.030
Is this question original?

381
00:13:33.032 --> 00:13:35.260
- It isn't. I heard it often on TV. - It's commonplace.

382
00:13:35.267 --> 00:13:37.260
- Is it commonplace? - Yes.

383
00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:38.370
I never heard of it.

384
00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:41.100
The tone of his voice was original.

385
00:13:41.107 --> 00:13:42.170
- His tone? - Yes.

386
00:13:42.174 --> 00:13:43.270
Right?

387
00:13:43.275 --> 00:13:45.710
- Have you heard of this tone? - I was never asked in that tone.

388
00:13:45.711 --> 00:13:48.380
- The way he asked was original. - It's refreshing.

389
00:13:48.981 --> 00:13:51.350
What do you think about the question, Joy and Irene?

390
00:13:51.817 --> 00:13:53.250
- You can reject it. - Joy can't hide...

391
00:13:53.252 --> 00:13:55.850
- her feelings. - She laughed when I said it.

392
00:13:55.921 --> 00:13:57.320
She laughed a lot.

393
00:13:57.556 --> 00:13:58.750
It's...

394
00:13:58.791 --> 00:14:00.090
not so original.

395
00:14:00.793 --> 00:14:02.560
You have to put a mark on his face.

396
00:14:02.561 --> 00:14:03.860
No, it's original.

397
00:14:05.397 --> 00:14:07.430
(How can I put a mark on his face?)

398
00:14:07.433 --> 00:14:09.200
- It's okay. - Why won't you do it?

399
00:14:09.201 --> 00:14:11.030
It's okay to put a mark on me.

400
00:14:11.036 --> 00:14:13.730
- It can be erased. - Put a mark on him.

401
00:14:13.906 --> 00:14:15.540
You can put it on. As I erase it,

402
00:14:15.541 --> 00:14:17.370
I'll think about you a lot.

403
00:14:19.145 --> 00:14:20.740
You're starting to get scary.

404
00:14:20.746 --> 00:14:21.910
(Your question is definitely original.)

405
00:14:21.914 --> 00:14:23.110
I'm tired.

406
00:14:23.916 --> 00:14:25.650
Can we take a break?

407
00:14:25.951 --> 00:14:28.150
- Haha. - I'm really tired.

408
00:14:28.754 --> 00:14:30.750
My heart is pounding.

409
00:14:30.756 --> 00:14:32.350
Are you telling the truth or not?

410
00:14:33.025 --> 00:14:34.820
- It's hard to tell. - Sit down.

411
00:14:35.161 --> 00:14:36.820
(He obeys.)

412
00:14:37.396 --> 00:14:38.490
Everyone.

413
00:14:38.731 --> 00:14:41.230
No one wants to put a mark on him, so we'll answer.

414
00:14:41.233 --> 00:14:42.500
In 1, 2, 3.

415
00:14:42.635 --> 00:14:44.600
(I wondered how a member was cast on the show.)

416
00:14:44.603 --> 00:14:46.000
Answer the question.

417
00:14:46.805 --> 00:14:50.740
(4 say yes, and 2 say no.)

418
00:14:51.243 --> 00:14:52.810
We need one more X.

419
00:14:52.811 --> 00:14:54.740
- We need one more X. - Right.

420
00:14:55.147 --> 00:14:56.380
I thought...

421
00:14:56.382 --> 00:14:58.480
Eun Hyuk was the main vocalist of Super Junior.

422
00:14:58.484 --> 00:14:59.550
- Me? - Yes.

423
00:14:59.552 --> 00:15:00.850
- Okay. - Aren't you good at dancing?

424
00:15:00.853 --> 00:15:02.720
- He looks like a good singer. - He's good at dance.

425
00:15:02.721 --> 00:15:04.620
There are two groups of people at SM Entertainment.

426
00:15:04.857 --> 00:15:06.750
There are people like Kang Ta...

427
00:15:07.159 --> 00:15:09.120
- or Woo Hyuk. - Woo Hyuk?

428
00:15:09.128 --> 00:15:10.930
The special ones are like Hairdresser Park Chul.

429
00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.530
That's right.

430
00:15:12.898 --> 00:15:16.000
(Hairdresser group at SM)

431
00:15:16.535 --> 00:15:19.330
Does he mean Park Chul Hair Salon?

432
00:15:20.272 --> 00:15:23.640
See how my question livened up the mood?

433
00:15:23.909 --> 00:15:25.010
Was it unoriginal?

434
00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:26.270
They're arguing.

435
00:15:26.278 --> 00:15:28.540
- Eun Hyuk was popular in school. - It's a realistic question.

436
00:15:28.547 --> 00:15:29.780
She keeps saying that.

437
00:15:29.782 --> 00:15:31.650
Eun Hyuk was very popular...

438
00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:34.150
- among girls in school. - Those who look ordinary and...

439
00:15:34.153 --> 00:15:35.720
- talkative are popular in school. - That's right.

440
00:15:35.721 --> 00:15:36.880
- It's because... - Please listen.

441
00:15:36.889 --> 00:15:39.190
- How was he so popular? - He was very popular.

442
00:15:39.191 --> 00:15:42.220
- Did he get many letters? - When Eun Hyuk liked someone,

443
00:15:42.228 --> 00:15:44.630
people wanted to know top 10 girls of his choice.

444
00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:45.960
I remember that.

445
00:15:46.031 --> 00:15:48.300
People wanted to make it on his list.

446
00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:49.400
- Was he that popular? - Yes.

447
00:15:49.401 --> 00:15:52.900
I think So Min still likes Eun Hyuk.

448
00:15:52.905 --> 00:15:54.130
- Me? - She likes everyone.

449
00:15:54.273 --> 00:15:55.470
He told me that...

450
00:15:55.474 --> 00:15:57.640
- you really liked him. - I didn't say that.

451
00:15:57.643 --> 00:15:59.010
Didn't you like me?

452
00:16:01.513 --> 00:16:04.380
(Didn't you like me?)

453
00:16:05.351 --> 00:16:06.580
Why are you...

454
00:16:06.752 --> 00:16:09.020
asking that question out of the blue?

455
00:16:09.154 --> 00:16:10.850
- Start over. - Goodness.

456
00:16:10.856 --> 00:16:12.520
Their romance doesn't seem interesting.

457
00:16:12.524 --> 00:16:15.390
(They don't seem interesting.)

458
00:16:15.394 --> 00:16:16.720
Seriously.

459
00:16:16.729 --> 00:16:18.160
(Their type of romance isn't interesting.)

460
00:16:18.163 --> 00:16:19.330
I don't want to see it.

461
00:16:19.331 --> 00:16:22.130
- Dong Hae keeps saying that... - He keeps whispering to me...

462
00:16:22.134 --> 00:16:24.370
- that she's cute. - So Min must be popular.

463
00:16:25.671 --> 00:16:26.870
Do you like her?

464
00:16:27.039 --> 00:16:28.600
I watched her on TV.

465
00:16:28.641 --> 00:16:30.900
She acted so cute.

466
00:16:31.143 --> 00:16:32.210
Really?

467
00:16:32.211 --> 00:16:34.740
- Eun Hyuk seems upset. - No, I'm not.

468
00:16:37.316 --> 00:16:39.480
(I have dibs on you, So Min.)

469
00:16:39.752 --> 00:16:41.380
She posed for the camera.

470
00:16:41.387 --> 00:16:43.450
- What? - She posed.

471
00:16:43.489 --> 00:16:45.620
(So Min is cute.)

472
00:16:45.791 --> 00:16:47.150
When the camera flashed,

473
00:16:47.159 --> 00:16:48.790
my heart...

474
00:16:48.794 --> 00:16:50.390
- Did it open up? - Yes.

475
00:16:51.563 --> 00:16:53.030
Now...

476
00:16:53.032 --> 00:16:55.400
- It's the other team's turn. - Is it?

477
00:16:55.401 --> 00:16:57.730
Let's see how original it is.

478
00:16:57.770 --> 00:16:59.730
- I'll say it. - That sounds good.

479
00:16:59.738 --> 00:17:01.470
- Seok Jin will say it... - He's taking initiative.

480
00:17:01.473 --> 00:17:03.500
- though we don't know what it is. - It will be original.

481
00:17:03.509 --> 00:17:04.740
- It's original. - Definitely.

482
00:17:04.743 --> 00:17:06.140
- It's definitely original. - He said it's good.

483
00:17:06.145 --> 00:17:07.640
He hasn't been this confident in a while.

484
00:17:07.646 --> 00:17:10.210
He's good at asking questions.

485
00:17:10.215 --> 00:17:12.280
- I used to ask questions. - On "Star Golden Bell".

486
00:17:12.284 --> 00:17:14.750
- I always asked questions. - That's true.

487
00:17:14.753 --> 00:17:15.920
"I have been..."

488
00:17:17.323 --> 00:17:20.350
"curious about other members' earnings."

489
00:17:20.459 --> 00:17:25.430
"I wondered if they earned more than me, so I..."

490
00:17:27.499 --> 00:17:28.900
(Yawning)

491
00:17:31.737 --> 00:17:33.200
(Let's put a mark on him.)

492
00:17:33.205 --> 00:17:36.940
"I asked about other members' earnings."

493
00:17:37.476 --> 00:17:38.810
"I did some research."

494
00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:42.780
Why are you drawing it?

495
00:17:43.082 --> 00:17:45.850
Why are you? Here's another question.

496
00:17:49.855 --> 00:17:52.190
(He takes a photo of Seok Jin.)

497
00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:54.020
Here's another one.

498
00:17:54.026 --> 00:17:57.390
(He likes to keep a souvenir of an unoriginal moment.)

499
00:17:57.863 --> 00:17:59.130
Here's another one.

500
00:17:59.264 --> 00:18:00.760
I'll judge myself.

501
00:18:00.766 --> 00:18:02.430
- Was he hit? - I accept it.

502
00:18:02.468 --> 00:18:03.500
It's your last chance.

503
00:18:03.502 --> 00:18:04.970
- "I..." - This is funny.

504
00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:06.770
- "I..." - He's so naive.

505
00:18:07.272 --> 00:18:12.440
"In the area of Seoul and its vicinity,"

506
00:18:12.511 --> 00:18:15.310
"I own an apartment that's bigger than 99m²."

507
00:18:15.714 --> 00:18:17.010
- What's wrong? - Why do you want to know?

508
00:18:17.015 --> 00:18:18.110
Is that your question?

509
00:18:18.283 --> 00:18:20.710
- What's wrong? - It's better to mark you.

510
00:18:21.587 --> 00:18:24.220
It's similar to your first question.

511
00:18:24.523 --> 00:18:27.590
Okay, I'll ask another question.

512
00:18:29.428 --> 00:18:30.960
The marker doesn't erase.

513
00:18:30.963 --> 00:18:32.460
Keep going.

514
00:18:32.464 --> 00:18:33.930
What? Doesn't it erase?

515
00:18:33.932 --> 00:18:35.030
Wait.

516
00:18:35.033 --> 00:18:36.830
- Kwang Soo used a permanent marker. - I'm sorry.

517
00:18:36.935 --> 00:18:38.470
I didn't mean to.

518
00:18:38.537 --> 00:18:40.400
I used it before.

519
00:18:40.539 --> 00:18:43.100
- It was in my pocket. - Kwang Soo.

520
00:18:43.108 --> 00:18:44.510
- It was in my pocket. - It's permanent.

521
00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:46.240
You're supposed to use this.

522
00:18:46.245 --> 00:18:47.940
I wondered why I had it.

523
00:18:47.946 --> 00:18:49.610
- I used it before. - No.

524
00:18:49.681 --> 00:18:51.480
I'll have it my way.

525
00:18:51.483 --> 00:18:52.850
- I'm upset. - I'm sorry.

526
00:18:52.851 --> 00:18:55.320
- Let me go. Okay. - Seriously.

527
00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.790
I'll ask an original question.

528
00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:01.150
- "I have more money than Seok Jin." - What's the original question?

529
00:19:01.827 --> 00:19:03.360
- Answer it. - That's enough.

530
00:19:03.362 --> 00:19:05.360
I bet half of you have more than me.

531
00:19:05.364 --> 00:19:07.130
Have you been drinking?

532
00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.030
Here's a question that was never asked before on TV.

533
00:19:11.036 --> 00:19:12.800
- I can't wait to hear it. - All right.

534
00:19:12.805 --> 00:19:15.370
"I eat fish starting with its head."

535
00:19:15.841 --> 00:19:17.270
(It's original but...)

536
00:19:17.276 --> 00:19:18.840
Come here.

537
00:19:19.211 --> 00:19:20.470
Isn't it original?

538
00:19:20.479 --> 00:19:22.680
Come here now.

539
00:19:22.681 --> 00:19:24.510
Isn't it original?

540
00:19:24.516 --> 00:19:26.010
- It's very original. - What did you say?

541
00:19:26.018 --> 00:19:28.820
(Neither team wins 10 dollars.)

542
00:19:30.756 --> 00:19:33.850
It's time to recruit new members.

543
00:19:33.859 --> 00:19:35.760
We will start...

544
00:19:35.761 --> 00:19:38.160
Super Rookie Recruit.

545
00:19:38.163 --> 00:19:40.760
(Super Rookie Recruit)

546
00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.360
(The winner of the mission can decide his team.)

547
00:19:43.368 --> 00:19:45.470
That sounds great.

548
00:19:45.571 --> 00:19:48.640
- It's like a military draft. - Here's the first category.

549
00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.870
The first test category is...

550
00:19:51.009 --> 00:19:52.410
energy.

551
00:19:52.411 --> 00:19:54.370
(Energy)

552
00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:56.080
- Energy? - We need energy.

553
00:19:56.081 --> 00:19:58.310
We need an energizer.

554
00:19:58.317 --> 00:20:00.350
We have one on our team.

555
00:20:00.352 --> 00:20:02.350
I won't tell who it is.

556
00:20:02.821 --> 00:20:05.020
- Look forward to it. - When they were young,

557
00:20:05.023 --> 00:20:07.190
So Min used to dance with Eun Hyuk.

558
00:20:07.192 --> 00:20:08.590
What kind of dance?

559
00:20:08.694 --> 00:20:12.230
We had a talent show in fourth grade.

560
00:20:12.231 --> 00:20:14.430
We danced to "3, 4" by Roo'ra.

561
00:20:14.566 --> 00:20:16.100
"3, 4"?

562
00:20:16.468 --> 00:20:20.500
(It's Roo'ra's hit song in the summer of 1996.)

563
00:20:20.506 --> 00:20:23.370
(It was a popular dance song during school trips.)

564
00:20:23.375 --> 00:20:24.870
(They danced together.)

565
00:20:24.877 --> 00:20:26.440
- Did you dance together? - Yes.

566
00:20:26.445 --> 00:20:28.010
Can you dance as a couple?

567
00:20:28.013 --> 00:20:32.110
I remember one part. I was on the floor.

568
00:20:32.351 --> 00:20:34.410
I remember that part.

569
00:20:34.419 --> 00:20:36.120
It was part of the dance.

570
00:20:36.321 --> 00:20:40.620
(Everyone has tried this dance to the song.)

571
00:20:41.226 --> 00:20:42.960
Doesn't it go like this?

572
00:20:42.961 --> 00:20:44.560
- At that time, - I remember it.

573
00:20:44.563 --> 00:20:46.860
I wore a short skirt.

574
00:20:46.865 --> 00:20:49.460
I danced while wearing a short skirt.

575
00:20:49.468 --> 00:20:51.200
It was too suggestive for fourth-graders.

576
00:20:51.203 --> 00:20:53.530
(The dance was too suggestive.)

577
00:20:53.539 --> 00:20:55.740
- What do you mean? - Come on, So Min.

578
00:20:55.741 --> 00:20:57.200
Why do you say that?

579
00:20:57.276 --> 00:21:00.910
It was too much for that age. Other kids screamed.

580
00:21:01.513 --> 00:21:02.880
You screamed the most.

581
00:21:02.881 --> 00:21:04.380
She's the only one excited.

582
00:21:05.017 --> 00:21:07.510
People are talking about your sweet potato comment.

583
00:21:07.519 --> 00:21:10.380
(Speaking of suggestive...)

584
00:21:10.489 --> 00:21:13.320
(What is So Min's sweet potato comment?)

585
00:21:14.259 --> 00:21:16.920
(Her comment was the talk of the town for a week.)

586
00:21:16.929 --> 00:21:20.060
(Jae Seok's is this small.)

587
00:21:21.033 --> 00:21:22.930
(Be careful what you say.)

588
00:21:22.935 --> 00:21:26.670
(They're sweet potatoes that I picked.)

589
00:21:27.773 --> 00:21:29.440
- Small Jae Seok. - Goodness.

590
00:21:29.441 --> 00:21:30.800
Small Jae Seok.

591
00:21:30.809 --> 00:21:32.110
Small Yu Jae Seok.

592
00:21:32.177 --> 00:21:34.540
- In Korea... - My goodness.

593
00:21:34.546 --> 00:21:37.040
Sweet potatoes remind me of you.

594
00:21:37.049 --> 00:21:38.950
You should advertise sweet potatoes.

595
00:21:39.518 --> 00:21:41.580
I have a lot to say,

596
00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:43.250
but I'll keep my mouth shut.

597
00:21:43.255 --> 00:21:45.620
(My goodness.)

598
00:21:45.724 --> 00:21:48.720
This is where national athletes train,

599
00:21:48.727 --> 00:21:50.020
so I won't say anymore.

600
00:21:50.028 --> 00:21:52.190
- That wasn't my intention. - That's enough.

601
00:21:52.197 --> 00:21:53.530
We all know.

602
00:21:53.532 --> 00:21:56.300
(He looks at So Min with loving eyes.)

603
00:21:56.401 --> 00:21:58.530
He's looking at her with loving eyes...

604
00:21:58.537 --> 00:22:00.370
- and hands in the pocket. - Goodness.

605
00:22:00.372 --> 00:22:02.270
He looks so cool.

606
00:22:02.274 --> 00:22:04.670
(Dong Hae seems so cool.)

607
00:22:04.977 --> 00:22:08.480
It's because I'm jealous that she keeps talking about Eun Hyuk.

608
00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.940
(He's jealous that she keeps talking about Eun Hyuk.)

609
00:22:10.949 --> 00:22:13.380
- What is this vibe? - Are we on "Love Letter"?

610
00:22:13.452 --> 00:22:14.780
Are we on "Love Letter"?

611
00:22:14.786 --> 00:22:16.280
- What's going on? - What are they doing?

612
00:22:16.288 --> 00:22:17.350
What's this?

613
00:22:17.356 --> 00:22:19.120
Dong Hae.

614
00:22:19.124 --> 00:22:21.090
You sound like someone from the early 2,000.

615
00:22:21.093 --> 00:22:24.290
(Dong Hae sounds like he's from the early 2,000.)

616
00:22:24.296 --> 00:22:26.690
(Dong Hae's comments are unusual...)

617
00:22:26.698 --> 00:22:28.460
(for current variety shows.)

618
00:22:28.467 --> 00:22:31.100
- It's perfect for "X Man"... - "X Man".

619
00:22:31.103 --> 00:22:32.430
- "Love Letters". - and "Love Letters".

620
00:22:32.437 --> 00:22:34.030
It would have been perfect.

621
00:22:34.039 --> 00:22:36.870
- It would've been perfect then. - You're right.

622
00:22:37.042 --> 00:22:40.040
His comment is outdated, but it's still good.

623
00:22:40.112 --> 00:22:43.540
Besides, we should liven up the mood.

624
00:22:43.548 --> 00:22:45.850
Eun Hyuk and So Min were...

625
00:22:45.851 --> 00:22:48.520
in the same class in fourth grade.

626
00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:49.920
(Couple Eun Hyuk and So Min's talent show)

627
00:22:49.921 --> 00:22:51.920
We finally get to see the performance...

628
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:53.420
as adults.

629
00:22:53.425 --> 00:22:54.820
(He's jealous.)

630
00:22:54.826 --> 00:22:56.020
Please play the music.

631
00:22:56.028 --> 00:22:59.130
("3!4!" by Roo'ra plays.)

632
00:22:59.131 --> 00:23:00.330
I haven't heard it in a while.

633
00:23:00.332 --> 00:23:01.930
They're all grown up.

634
00:23:02.401 --> 00:23:03.830
They grew up in Ilsan.

635
00:23:03.835 --> 00:23:04.970
(They dance again after 20 years.)

636
00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:07.770
They're from Neunggok Elementary School.

637
00:23:07.773 --> 00:23:08.940
Which grade and class are you in?

638
00:23:08.974 --> 00:23:11.100
- 4th grade, class 6. - 4th grade, class 6.

639
00:23:11.109 --> 00:23:13.640
- They're Eun Hyuk... - They're grown up.

640
00:23:14.012 --> 00:23:15.280
Let's go.

641
00:23:16.081 --> 00:23:17.340
Here it comes.

642
00:23:18.016 --> 00:23:20.550
(This is the first move.)

643
00:23:22.487 --> 00:23:26.420
(They dance perfectly in sync.)

644
00:23:26.491 --> 00:23:28.790
This is it.

645
00:23:29.561 --> 00:23:31.660
(When Hyuk Jae claps his hands,)

646
00:23:31.663 --> 00:23:32.760
(So Min claps hers.)

647
00:23:32.764 --> 00:23:33.790
They remember it.

648
00:23:33.799 --> 00:23:35.730
(Hyuk Jae and So Min are bringing back everyone's memories.)

649
00:23:35.734 --> 00:23:36.830
Back in elementary school...

650
00:23:38.236 --> 00:23:39.230
It's the rapping part.

651
00:23:39.237 --> 00:23:40.470
(This part is mine.)

652
00:23:41.773 --> 00:23:43.770
(Perfectly in sync)

653
00:23:43.775 --> 00:23:45.610
They remember the dance.

654
00:23:45.677 --> 00:23:47.710
(All generations dance together.)

655
00:23:47.713 --> 00:23:48.810
They remember everything.

656
00:23:49.581 --> 00:23:51.910
It's been 20 years, and they remember everything.

657
00:23:51.917 --> 00:23:53.410
It's touching.

658
00:23:53.418 --> 00:23:56.120
(We're Neunggok Elementary School's Roo'ra.)

659
00:23:56.455 --> 00:23:58.020
Here we go.

660
00:23:58.023 --> 00:23:59.850
(It's the between-the-legs dance part.)

661
00:24:00.959 --> 00:24:02.590
(Lying down flat)

662
00:24:02.594 --> 00:24:03.860
Here we go!

663
00:24:06.031 --> 00:24:11.800
(They pull off the dance they found provocative back in 4th grade.)

664
00:24:11.803 --> 00:24:13.600
Joy, lie down.

665
00:24:13.605 --> 00:24:15.370
Please give them a big hand.

666
00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:16.540
(We haven't changed a bit.)

667
00:24:16.541 --> 00:24:19.310
- They were so cute. - They remember everything.

668
00:24:19.311 --> 00:24:21.310
- Their bodies remember it. - They remember it so well.

669
00:24:21.313 --> 00:24:23.780
They looked at each other and then remembered this.

670
00:24:23.782 --> 00:24:26.010
It gave me goosebumps.

671
00:24:26.418 --> 00:24:28.520
It was touching.

672
00:24:29.254 --> 00:24:31.280
So Min, how did you feel?

673
00:24:31.289 --> 00:24:34.920
It was a heart-warming moment.

674
00:24:34.926 --> 00:24:36.090
- It was? - Yes.

675
00:24:36.094 --> 00:24:39.460
I thought I had forgotten everything,

676
00:24:39.731 --> 00:24:42.130
but when I saw So Min's face, everything came back.

677
00:24:42.801 --> 00:24:43.900
Memories came back.

678
00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:49.140
(Just by seeing each other's faces, they can go back to the old days.)

679
00:24:49.141 --> 00:24:54.110
(Childhood friends, Hyuk Jae and So Min)

680
00:24:54.913 --> 00:24:57.010
All the memories came back.

681
00:24:57.682 --> 00:25:00.050
It's incredible. It gave me goosebumps.

682
00:25:00.786 --> 00:25:02.620
- It brought back memories? - Yes.

683
00:25:02.821 --> 00:25:06.550
When Seok Jin does this,

684
00:25:06.625 --> 00:25:08.660
- he looks so professional. - What do you mean?

685
00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:11.220
"I'm going to cry."

686
00:25:11.229 --> 00:25:12.560
(While watching them dance)

687
00:25:12.564 --> 00:25:15.430
(Crying)

688
00:25:15.433 --> 00:25:20.300
- It sounded so dry. - It sounded dry.

689
00:25:20.305 --> 00:25:22.170
- He said he was going to cry. - It was touching.

690
00:25:22.207 --> 00:25:23.440
Big respect.

691
00:25:23.608 --> 00:25:27.210
Everyone, it's time to test...

692
00:25:27.212 --> 00:25:28.540
- everyone's energy. - Let's go.

693
00:25:28.547 --> 00:25:31.180
- Energy matters more than skills. - Of course.

694
00:25:31.183 --> 00:25:34.610
You just need to show off your energy.

695
00:25:34.619 --> 00:25:37.080
- Just show us what you got. - Okay.

696
00:25:37.088 --> 00:25:38.750
Give us some music. Teuk.

697
00:25:38.757 --> 00:25:40.290
(Lee Teuk)

698
00:25:40.292 --> 00:25:42.360
- Let's do this. - Great.

699
00:25:42.727 --> 00:25:45.060
- Good. - Look at him.

700
00:25:45.564 --> 00:25:48.030
- You're doing great. - Here comes So Min.

701
00:25:48.033 --> 00:25:49.800
- So Min is dancing. - So Min.

702
00:25:49.801 --> 00:25:51.770
- What is she doing? - And Eun Hyuk.

703
00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:53.100
What are they doing?

704
00:25:53.805 --> 00:25:55.100
What?

705
00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:56.440
Gosh.

706
00:25:56.441 --> 00:25:57.500
(I'm getting jealous again.)

707
00:25:57.509 --> 00:25:58.610
Another one.

708
00:25:59.244 --> 00:26:00.310
I love it.

709
00:26:00.312 --> 00:26:03.940
(So Min is holding her fingers up.)

710
00:26:03.949 --> 00:26:06.210
- Hey, when did you come? - What?

711
00:26:06.218 --> 00:26:07.680
- Guys. - Gosh. What is this?

712
00:26:07.686 --> 00:26:09.320
This is not a team dinner.

713
00:26:09.621 --> 00:26:11.790
It's so old-fashioned.

714
00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:13.850
Also,

715
00:26:13.959 --> 00:26:16.290
let me tell you what bothered me the most.

716
00:26:16.294 --> 00:26:18.430
Instead of just dancing, So Min...

717
00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:21.900
(She was holding her fingers up.)

718
00:26:22.801 --> 00:26:24.430
- Why did you do that? - What was that?

719
00:26:24.536 --> 00:26:26.470
- Seriously. - She wanted to look attractive.

720
00:26:26.972 --> 00:26:29.370
Gosh, you looked like a tyrannosaurus.

721
00:26:29.374 --> 00:26:30.500
(Her fingers looked like those of a tyrannosaurus.)

722
00:26:30.508 --> 00:26:32.310
It looked awful.

723
00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:34.940
You have to forget about...

724
00:26:34.946 --> 00:26:37.080
- the old ways. - Forget about them all.

725
00:26:37.082 --> 00:26:38.680
You don't have to dance.

726
00:26:38.683 --> 00:26:41.010
- You don't have to dance. - You don't.

727
00:26:41.019 --> 00:26:43.220
Even if I give you a sign, if you don't want to, don't dance.

728
00:26:43.321 --> 00:26:47.920
These days, you're expected to be natural on variety shows.

729
00:26:47.926 --> 00:26:50.720
Get used to variety shows these days.

730
00:26:50.729 --> 00:26:53.490
(Everyone, get used to the new way.)

731
00:26:53.498 --> 00:26:55.100
This is so old-fashioned.

732
00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:56.230
(I'm sorry, but...)

733
00:26:56.234 --> 00:26:57.760
(It should look like this.)

734
00:26:57.769 --> 00:26:59.570
- It's just like the old days. - No, it's not.

735
00:26:59.571 --> 00:27:00.930
(That's absurd.)

736
00:27:00.939 --> 00:27:02.040
It's back.

737
00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:06.010
This is the variety show of the 21st century.

738
00:27:06.011 --> 00:27:07.110
(This is the new way.)

739
00:27:07.112 --> 00:27:08.680
How exactly is it different?

740
00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:11.680
I used to step up and dance alone.

741
00:27:13.285 --> 00:27:17.280
(Jae Seok used to dance alone.)

742
00:27:17.923 --> 00:27:20.720
- He doesn't do it anymore. - These days, I remain in my place.

743
00:27:20.725 --> 00:27:23.860
(Jae Seok is more cautious now.)

744
00:27:23.862 --> 00:27:25.930
I just point out a few things.

745
00:27:26.431 --> 00:27:29.430
- Like this. - It is different.

746
00:27:29.601 --> 00:27:32.230
All right. Give us some music.

747
00:27:32.237 --> 00:27:33.230
(It's the 21st-century style.)

748
00:27:33.238 --> 00:27:35.440
- They don't have to dance. - No.

749
00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:36.970
Do whatever you want.

750
00:27:37.709 --> 00:27:39.110
This music is from such a long time ago.

751
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:40.240
(Dancing)

752
00:27:40.245 --> 00:27:41.310
Jae Seok is dancing.

753
00:27:41.313 --> 00:27:42.610
He wants to.

754
00:27:43.181 --> 00:27:46.010
- He wants to dance. - That's why he's dancing.

755
00:27:46.217 --> 00:27:47.610
He's a good dancer.

756
00:27:47.786 --> 00:27:49.880
- What? - You don't think so?

757
00:27:50.021 --> 00:27:51.520
Some are joining.

758
00:27:51.523 --> 00:27:53.020
Right? See?

759
00:27:53.024 --> 00:27:55.320
- Go. - Go.

760
00:27:55.694 --> 00:27:56.690
Go.

761
00:27:56.695 --> 00:27:58.290
(Others are voluntarily joining.)

762
00:27:58.363 --> 00:28:00.060
- It's "Heartless". - "Heartless".

763
00:28:00.198 --> 00:28:02.500
- Dong Hae, let's go. - Dance if you want.

764
00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:03.600
Dong Hae, let's go.

765
00:28:03.601 --> 00:28:05.130
(No)

766
00:28:06.671 --> 00:28:08.030
(Jae Seok stops the music.)

767
00:28:08.039 --> 00:28:09.770
- Why did you stop the music? - Why did you stop it?

768
00:28:09.774 --> 00:28:12.010
- You said it was voluntary. - At first, you should dance.

769
00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:14.980
- You stopped the music. - You said they didn't have to.

770
00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:16.710
You stopped the music.

771
00:28:16.715 --> 00:28:19.810
- You said we didn't have to. - But that's not okay.

772
00:28:19.851 --> 00:28:21.950
"Dong Hae." He should do something like this.

773
00:28:22.354 --> 00:28:23.450
This is not okay.

774
00:28:23.621 --> 00:28:26.290
- It's the 21st-century style. - He doesn't want to dance.

775
00:28:26.291 --> 00:28:27.590
- This is not okay. - How are they different?

776
00:28:27.592 --> 00:28:29.520
- This is not okay. - We're sorry.

777
00:28:29.527 --> 00:28:31.760
Our viewers are watching. Let's do this again.

778
00:28:31.763 --> 00:28:35.560
- We'll play another song. - Play a different one.

779
00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:38.260
Guys, like this.

780
00:28:38.536 --> 00:28:39.770
- Like this. - What is this?

781
00:28:39.771 --> 00:28:42.870
(Red Velvet's energy level is going up.)

782
00:28:43.341 --> 00:28:46.140
Here we go. The beat is yours!

783
00:28:47.045 --> 00:28:49.080
(Let's do this, Hyuk Jae.)

784
00:28:50.248 --> 00:28:53.280
(Energy explosion)

785
00:28:54.285 --> 00:28:56.420
Can I slap him?

786
00:28:57.489 --> 00:28:59.790
(Slap)

787
00:28:59.791 --> 00:29:02.090
Joy knows this song.

788
00:29:02.193 --> 00:29:03.220
Line up.

789
00:29:03.228 --> 00:29:05.930
(Joy encouraged others to join.)

790
00:29:06.698 --> 00:29:08.800
- Here we go. - 1, 2.

791
00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.900
(Slap)

792
00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:12.770
Next.

793
00:29:12.771 --> 00:29:14.670
(Next up is Haha.)

794
00:29:15.373 --> 00:29:16.470
I want to do it too.

795
00:29:16.941 --> 00:29:19.040
(Slap)

796
00:29:19.044 --> 00:29:20.040
There you go.

797
00:29:20.045 --> 00:29:21.610
(Joy's slaps give others energy.)

798
00:29:21.613 --> 00:29:22.780
Joy is so good.

799
00:29:23.014 --> 00:29:24.880
(Let's try it.)

800
00:29:25.483 --> 00:29:27.780
(Joy's slap time is over.)

801
00:29:27.786 --> 00:29:29.120
- It's over. - It's over.

802
00:29:29.487 --> 00:29:30.950
(The energy test is over.)

803
00:29:30.955 --> 00:29:32.750
- It's broken. - It's broken.

804
00:29:32.757 --> 00:29:34.190
(Kwang Soo's phone is broken.)

805
00:29:34.192 --> 00:29:36.560
- The screen is broken. - He stepped on it himself.

806
00:29:36.561 --> 00:29:38.760
- The screen is broken. - The screen is broken.

807
00:29:38.763 --> 00:29:39.860
(Kwang Soo broke his own phone.)

808
00:29:40.865 --> 00:29:43.300
(While they were dancing...)

809
00:29:43.301 --> 00:29:45.370
Kwang Soo. Oh, I'm late.

810
00:29:45.503 --> 00:29:47.130
You stepped on it twice.

811
00:29:48.039 --> 00:29:50.940
He can't blame anyone. He dropped it himself...

812
00:29:50.975 --> 00:29:52.110
and stepped on it.

813
00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:54.240
It made such a loud sound.

814
00:29:54.245 --> 00:29:56.880
I heard it so clearly. I did it.

815
00:29:56.881 --> 00:30:00.780
Kwang Soo must be so frustrated. He can't blame anyone.

816
00:30:00.785 --> 00:30:03.550
I want to go fix it right now.

817
00:30:03.955 --> 00:30:04.950
It's okay.

818
00:30:04.956 --> 00:30:06.050
(When will we be finished?)

819
00:30:07.025 --> 00:30:10.790
The second test is Acupressure Mat Long Jump.

820
00:30:10.795 --> 00:30:12.830
Let's see who wins.

821
00:30:12.831 --> 00:30:15.630
(Acupressure Mat Long Jump)

822
00:30:16.401 --> 00:30:18.360
Acupressure Mat Long Jump? Gosh...

823
00:30:18.703 --> 00:30:21.600
You'll jump three times.

824
00:30:21.606 --> 00:30:23.440
The one who jumps the furthest wins.

825
00:30:23.508 --> 00:30:25.970
If you scream, you'll be eliminated.

826
00:30:25.977 --> 00:30:27.010
(Eliminated)

827
00:30:27.011 --> 00:30:29.440
- Did you hear the instructions? - Yes.

828
00:30:29.447 --> 00:30:31.080
- You jump three times. - Okay.

829
00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:36.620
I think someone with experience should demonstrate.

830
00:30:36.621 --> 00:30:37.780
Seok Jin.

831
00:30:37.789 --> 00:30:38.790
(Seok Jin should demonstrate.)

832
00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:39.890
Me?

833
00:30:40.425 --> 00:30:41.820
You've done it many times.

834
00:30:42.026 --> 00:30:43.820
So far...

835
00:30:43.828 --> 00:30:46.030
- Show them how we do it. - Show them.

836
00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:49.300
Seok Jin will demonstrate.

837
00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:50.400
(How will he do?)

838
00:30:51.035 --> 00:30:53.730
Guys. First of all...

839
00:30:53.738 --> 00:30:54.970
You have to take off your socks, right?

840
00:30:54.973 --> 00:30:57.200
First of all, take off your socks.

841
00:30:57.208 --> 00:30:59.510
- That's the basic attitude. - He's very good.

842
00:30:59.511 --> 00:31:02.780
You have to take off your socks as well as your shoes.

843
00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:04.510
And put your socks on your hands.

844
00:31:04.516 --> 00:31:06.280
(The next step)

845
00:31:06.284 --> 00:31:08.010
- Really? - Put them on your hands.

846
00:31:08.019 --> 00:31:09.450
- Really? - Yes.

847
00:31:10.021 --> 00:31:12.090
To prevent injuring your hands...

848
00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:14.820
- Put your socks on your hands. - To prevent injury.

849
00:31:14.826 --> 00:31:16.260
- "Really?" - Of course.

850
00:31:16.261 --> 00:31:17.290
"Really?"

851
00:31:17.295 --> 00:31:20.830
You might think we start here, but no.

852
00:31:20.832 --> 00:31:24.430
- No. - You start here. That's the point.

853
00:31:24.435 --> 00:31:28.100
(You start on the acupressure mat.)

854
00:31:28.106 --> 00:31:31.370
If it hurts, take a break.

855
00:31:31.576 --> 00:31:34.740
Seok Jin, please speed up.

856
00:31:34.746 --> 00:31:37.880
We're going to jump three times.

857
00:31:38.283 --> 00:31:39.880
Ready, start.

858
00:31:41.452 --> 00:31:42.580
Don't scream.

859
00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:43.820
(Screaming)

860
00:31:43.821 --> 00:31:45.890
(Moaning)

861
00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:47.920
This is how you do it.

862
00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:51.090
(This is how you do it.)

863
00:31:51.095 --> 00:31:52.960
What do you mean?

864
00:31:52.964 --> 00:31:55.400
You screamed three times.

865
00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:57.730
- No. - I can't walk.

866
00:31:57.735 --> 00:31:58.800
(Seok Jin's class is canceled.)

867
00:31:58.803 --> 00:32:01.170
Seok Jin jumped about 4m.

868
00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:05.000
So Min and Se Chan...

869
00:32:05.009 --> 00:32:06.510
- They've never done it. - have never tried it.

870
00:32:06.511 --> 00:32:07.770
- Right. - I've never done it.

871
00:32:07.779 --> 00:32:10.180
Se Chan and So Min will try it.

872
00:32:10.281 --> 00:32:11.280
So Min.

873
00:32:11.282 --> 00:32:12.350
(Their first encounter with the acupressure mat)

874
00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:14.780
I've never done it.

875
00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:19.020
By the way, why do we put the socks on our hands?

876
00:32:19.023 --> 00:32:20.590
I don't know. Haha told me to.

877
00:32:20.592 --> 00:32:23.160
You don't have to do it.

878
00:32:23.361 --> 00:32:24.360
(So Min is dusting her feet.)

879
00:32:24.362 --> 00:32:25.490
Well...

880
00:32:25.496 --> 00:32:27.260
Stop dusting your feet.

881
00:32:27.265 --> 00:32:29.530
(So Min, stop dusting your feet.)

882
00:32:29.534 --> 00:32:31.930
- Her socks are black. - So Min, what are you doing?

883
00:32:31.936 --> 00:32:33.130
Your feet will get dirty anyway.

884
00:32:33.538 --> 00:32:35.070
(She puts her socks on her hands.)

885
00:32:35.073 --> 00:32:37.200
- You don't have to do that. - I don't?

886
00:32:37.208 --> 00:32:39.440
(You don't have to put your socks on your hands.)

887
00:32:39.444 --> 00:32:40.710
You don't have to.

888
00:32:40.712 --> 00:32:41.710
(Se Chan and So Min are clumsy.)

889
00:32:41.713 --> 00:32:42.710
- I don't have to? - Why do you do that?

890
00:32:42.714 --> 00:32:44.410
- Why are these wet? - You don't have to.

891
00:32:44.415 --> 00:32:47.280
But if you touch the mat with your hands, it hurts a lot.

892
00:32:48.019 --> 00:32:49.120
Ready.

893
00:32:50.188 --> 00:32:51.780
- You can jump on one foot. - Start.

894
00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:53.490
(Screaming)

895
00:32:53.491 --> 00:32:56.290
(Laughing)

896
00:32:57.228 --> 00:33:00.360
It hurts. It really hurts.

897
00:33:00.365 --> 00:33:01.360
(So Min fails.)

898
00:33:01.366 --> 00:33:03.030
This part hurts a lot.

899
00:33:03.034 --> 00:33:04.530
It's awful.

900
00:33:04.535 --> 00:33:06.030
How do you feel?

901
00:33:06.704 --> 00:33:09.770
(Taking a picture)

902
00:33:10.541 --> 00:33:11.740
That was funny.

903
00:33:11.743 --> 00:33:12.840
(Are you hurt? I'm hurt too.)

904
00:33:14.279 --> 00:33:16.110
I thought he was going to help her.

905
00:33:16.814 --> 00:33:17.910
(Se Chan's turn)

906
00:33:17.915 --> 00:33:20.880
You have to clench your teeth and endure the pain.

907
00:33:21.085 --> 00:33:22.920
- Clench your teeth. - You have to brace yourself.

908
00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:23.920
Don't scream.

909
00:33:23.921 --> 00:33:25.020
(Good luck.)

910
00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:28.190
- Break your teeth. - Jump to the end.

911
00:33:28.192 --> 00:33:29.460
(Let me try.)

912
00:33:31.663 --> 00:33:34.260
(Se Chan takes a leap with determination.)

913
00:33:34.265 --> 00:33:35.260
(His 1st jump lands him at 2.5m.)

914
00:33:35.266 --> 00:33:37.200
- He's like a frog. - I guess he doesn't feel any pain.

915
00:33:37.201 --> 00:33:39.400
- He's like a frog. - Hey, doesn't it hurt?

916
00:33:39.537 --> 00:33:41.130
- This part really hurts. - I bet it's really painful.

917
00:33:41.539 --> 00:33:43.040
Gosh, I guess he doesn't feel any pain.

918
00:33:43.541 --> 00:33:45.410
That's the hard part.

919
00:33:46.611 --> 00:33:48.070
(The last 5m is more painful as the bumps are bigger.)

920
00:33:48.079 --> 00:33:49.980
Se Chan, the last part hurts so much. I'm not lying.

921
00:33:49.981 --> 00:33:52.040
(This is a section no one can pass without yelping.)

922
00:33:52.216 --> 00:33:53.380
You're going to hold it in again?

923
00:33:54.919 --> 00:33:57.580
(Se Chan jumps energetically.)

924
00:33:57.588 --> 00:34:00.220
(Son of a...)

925
00:34:00.224 --> 00:34:01.450
Pardon my swearing.

926
00:34:02.293 --> 00:34:04.520
(Se Chan fails to pass the hardest section as expected.)

927
00:34:04.529 --> 00:34:05.660
No one can pass this section.

928
00:34:05.663 --> 00:34:07.360
- It's really painful. It hurts. - My goodness.

929
00:34:07.598 --> 00:34:10.100
- This is how it ought to be though. - The first part is doable.

930
00:34:10.101 --> 00:34:12.170
I can deal with this green part,

931
00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:13.670
but the second part is where it really hurts.

932
00:34:13.671 --> 00:34:15.440
The 1st part is fine, but not the 2nd.

933
00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:17.800
Why don't we all try this?

934
00:34:18.643 --> 00:34:20.840
- I'd like to go 1st. - Really? Dong Hae will go 1st.

935
00:34:21.145 --> 00:34:22.980
He must do well in order to take the first place.

936
00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:24.240
- You can't make a sound. - Right.

937
00:34:24.248 --> 00:34:25.510
- Start. - He's good.

938
00:34:25.516 --> 00:34:26.950
Dong Hae used to be a good fighter.

939
00:34:26.951 --> 00:34:28.310
(Dong Hae gives it a try.)

940
00:34:28.453 --> 00:34:29.950
- So Min is watching. - Here I go.

941
00:34:30.088 --> 00:34:31.480
If he can match...

942
00:34:33.458 --> 00:34:34.620
(He reaches 2.5m easily.)

943
00:34:34.625 --> 00:34:36.990
- He's really good. It was true. - He's good at jumping.

944
00:34:37.128 --> 00:34:38.730
He's good at standing long jumps.

945
00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:40.060
(So Min, did you see that?)

946
00:34:40.064 --> 00:34:41.790
- That was his first jump. - That was great.

947
00:34:41.933 --> 00:34:43.030
He's charismatic.

948
00:34:43.034 --> 00:34:44.060
(I'm attracted to him.)

949
00:34:44.068 --> 00:34:45.430
You'll be fine.

950
00:34:45.436 --> 00:34:46.770
(After giving So Min a look...)

951
00:34:46.771 --> 00:34:48.300
My gosh, what a jump.

952
00:34:48.373 --> 00:34:49.640
Hey, you're good at this.

953
00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:51.540
- You're doing well. - You're good.

954
00:34:51.542 --> 00:34:53.510
I feel like I'm watching "X-Man" again. I'm nervous.

955
00:34:54.011 --> 00:34:55.540
- If he keeps this up... - All right. Here's he goes.

956
00:34:55.546 --> 00:34:57.340
- It's better to stay away from it. - Here it goes.

957
00:34:57.348 --> 00:34:59.950
(At last, the hardest section of the acupressure mat lies before him.)

958
00:35:00.852 --> 00:35:05.550
(Fearless Dong Hae jumps with all his might.)

959
00:35:06.724 --> 00:35:10.060
(Will he be the first one to succeed?)

960
00:35:10.061 --> 00:35:12.830
(That's incredible! After he lands without making a sound,)

961
00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:14.760
(he takes a selfie.)

962
00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.930
(I'm going to record the moment of my success.)

963
00:35:18.202 --> 00:35:20.870
("Acupressure Mat Got Nothing on Me!")

964
00:35:21.372 --> 00:35:25.810
(They respect his passion for photography.)

965
00:35:25.877 --> 00:35:27.240
- He didn't make a sound. - That was seven...

966
00:35:27.245 --> 00:35:29.980
- That was great. - His record is 7.3m.

967
00:35:29.981 --> 00:35:31.110
(Dong Hae)

968
00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:32.850
Joy, why don't you try?

969
00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:34.050
Her record is 6.7m.

970
00:35:34.051 --> 00:35:35.010
(She succeeded to reach 6.7m.)

971
00:35:35.019 --> 00:35:36.520
Lee Teuk's record is 6m.

972
00:35:36.521 --> 00:35:39.120
(On the other side, Lee Teuk makes a sound and fails.)

973
00:35:39.123 --> 00:35:40.990
His record is 7.7m.

974
00:35:40.992 --> 00:35:42.460
(Ye Sung takes the 1st place with a record of 7.7m.)

975
00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:44.660
Eun Hyuk, you should give it a go.

976
00:35:44.662 --> 00:35:46.430
- I lost out to Joy. - Now, I kind of...

977
00:35:46.831 --> 00:35:48.630
- want to break the record. - I bet.

978
00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:51.330
Eun Hyuk is quite athletic.

979
00:35:51.335 --> 00:35:52.770
(Eun Hyuk's known to be a good athlete.)

980
00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:54.570
But could I be able to break the record?

981
00:35:54.605 --> 00:35:55.740
You're starting in five,

982
00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:58.140
- 4, 3... - Hold on.

983
00:36:00.144 --> 00:36:02.280
(Eun Hyuk leaps energetically.)

984
00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:04.540
The highest record is Ye Sung's 7.7m.

985
00:36:04.549 --> 00:36:08.780
(Eun Hyuk wanted to break the record. How will his first jump go?)

986
00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:10.880
- Hang on a second. Wait. - Hey.

987
00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:15.890
(He's surprised at how painful the mat is.)

988
00:36:15.893 --> 00:36:20.560
(Forget about the record. He hits the road after screaming.)

989
00:36:20.565 --> 00:36:23.530
He said he was going to break the record. He's really lame.

990
00:36:24.602 --> 00:36:25.870
You failed.

991
00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:27.830
- You failed. - Can I get one more chance later?

992
00:36:27.839 --> 00:36:29.800
(Screaming in pain)

993
00:36:29.874 --> 00:36:31.040
That really hurts.

994
00:36:31.042 --> 00:36:32.470
We'll grant you one last chance.

995
00:36:32.477 --> 00:36:35.340
(Taking his will into consideration, he gets to try again.)

996
00:36:36.781 --> 00:36:38.280
(He successfully lands without groaning.)

997
00:36:38.282 --> 00:36:39.450
He held it in.

998
00:36:40.051 --> 00:36:41.280
- He held it in. - He might go all the way.

999
00:36:41.853 --> 00:36:44.120
(This is his second jump.)

1000
00:36:44.121 --> 00:36:45.950
- He came far. - He got here only after two jumps.

1001
00:36:45.957 --> 00:36:49.120
(He enters the bumpy section with his second jump.)

1002
00:36:49.126 --> 00:36:50.990
- It only took him two jumps. - All right.

1003
00:36:50.995 --> 00:36:52.430
- This is your last jump. - Go on.

1004
00:36:52.497 --> 00:36:54.660
The colors of your lips and your hair are exactly the same.

1005
00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:57.000
- Your lips are purple! - Here's your last jump.

1006
00:36:57.101 --> 00:36:58.330
- You can give up. - The last jump.

1007
00:36:58.336 --> 00:36:59.800
- This is your last jump, Eun Hyuk. - My goodness.

1008
00:37:00.471 --> 00:37:01.570
Your last jump, Eun Hyuk.

1009
00:37:01.939 --> 00:37:03.770
(He enters the hardest section no one can pass without screaming.)

1010
00:37:03.774 --> 00:37:05.100
Jump now.

1011
00:37:05.109 --> 00:37:06.910
(He enters the hardest section no one can pass without screaming.)

1012
00:37:06.911 --> 00:37:08.670
(Can he hold in his scream and break Ye Sung's record of 7.7m?)

1013
00:37:08.679 --> 00:37:09.680
Hey, it really hurts.

1014
00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:14.910
(Can he hold in his scream and break Ye Sung's record of 7.7m?)

1015
00:37:17.622 --> 00:37:19.020
8.3m!

1016
00:37:19.023 --> 00:37:22.990
(He safely lands at 8.3m without letting out a single yelp.)

1017
00:37:24.428 --> 00:37:25.930
(He's in pain.)

1018
00:37:26.497 --> 00:37:30.300
(With his athleticism and patience, Eun Hyuk takes 1st place.)

1019
00:37:30.301 --> 00:37:32.570
(His feet are throbbing.)

1020
00:37:33.271 --> 00:37:36.970
(Their jaws are dropping. Eun Hyuk earns members' respect.)

1021
00:37:37.542 --> 00:37:38.800
(Eun Hyuk is in 1st place.)

1022
00:37:38.809 --> 00:37:41.240
- Good job. You have my respect. - That was amazing.

1023
00:37:41.245 --> 00:37:44.080
So that wraps up our game, our winner...

1024
00:37:44.315 --> 00:37:45.440
is Eun Hyuk.

1025
00:37:46.083 --> 00:37:47.610
You're in first place.

1026
00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:50.350
He should join this team.

1027
00:37:50.354 --> 00:37:51.820
Eun Hyuk is going to choose the members, right?

1028
00:37:51.956 --> 00:37:53.220
I don't like either of them.

1029
00:37:53.224 --> 00:37:54.620
(Dong Hae, Ye Sung, and Irene join Team Hare and Tortoise.)

1030
00:37:54.625 --> 00:37:55.890
(Team Hare and Tortoise versus Team Big Nose)

1031
00:37:55.893 --> 00:37:58.160
(Lee Teuk, Eun Hyuk, and Joy join Team Big Nose.)

1032
00:37:59.063 --> 00:38:02.090
Following the result of Super Rookie Recruit,

1033
00:38:02.099 --> 00:38:04.360
Team Big Nose will receive a Chance Card.

1034
00:38:04.368 --> 00:38:05.460
Nice!

1035
00:38:05.603 --> 00:38:07.200
That wasn't an easy task.

1036
00:38:07.204 --> 00:38:09.370
- You are divided into your teams. - Yes.

1037
00:38:09.941 --> 00:38:12.000
In order to get an upper hand to scramble for get-together money,

1038
00:38:12.009 --> 00:38:14.740
in each team, there's a spy.

1039
00:38:14.745 --> 00:38:17.480
(There's a spy in each team to win more money for the get-together.)

1040
00:38:17.481 --> 00:38:19.410
(Hold up. There's a spy in our team?)

1041
00:38:19.417 --> 00:38:20.550
- Are you serious? - What?

1042
00:38:20.551 --> 00:38:21.950
- That came out of nowhere. - Really?

1043
00:38:22.019 --> 00:38:23.020
- Who's the spy? - Right now...

1044
00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:24.550
What's wrong with you, Jae Seok?

1045
00:38:24.855 --> 00:38:27.390
(There's no need to investigate. Kwang Soo is the spy.)

1046
00:38:27.391 --> 00:38:28.990
- I knew something was off. - What are you doing?

1047
00:38:28.993 --> 00:38:30.360
How many times are you going to be the spy?

1048
00:38:30.361 --> 00:38:31.590
- No, I'm not the spy. - You were acting strange.

1049
00:38:31.829 --> 00:38:33.660
- There's a spy in our team? - I think I know who the spy is.

1050
00:38:34.332 --> 00:38:36.360
I knew it. When Irene joined our team,

1051
00:38:36.701 --> 00:38:37.930
I wondered why she'd come.

1052
00:38:38.069 --> 00:38:40.470
The spies must conceal their identities...

1053
00:38:40.471 --> 00:38:44.240
in the opposing teams and help their teams to win the race.

1054
00:38:44.709 --> 00:38:46.640
So the spies are going to help the opposing teams.

1055
00:38:46.644 --> 00:38:48.370
- That's right. - This is just like "X-Man".

1056
00:38:48.379 --> 00:38:50.540
The team who apprehends the spy in the final race...

1057
00:38:50.548 --> 00:38:52.850
will be given extra 50 dollars for the get-together.

1058
00:38:54.318 --> 00:38:57.320
(Each team has a spy. Who are these spies?)

1059
00:38:57.688 --> 00:39:00.720
Starting now, the spies should start their mission.

1060
00:39:00.725 --> 00:39:03.120
The rest of you must try to figure out who they are...

1061
00:39:03.127 --> 00:39:06.630
in your team and the opposing team.

1062
00:39:06.631 --> 00:39:08.360
- I'm an expert in this. - Right.

1063
00:39:08.599 --> 00:39:11.530
I'm going to catch those spies within 30 minutes. Watch and learn.

1064
00:39:11.569 --> 00:39:15.030
- I bet Jae Seok is the spy. - Aren't you the spy?

1065
00:39:15.106 --> 00:39:16.740
I'm sure it's Jae Seok. It has to be him.

1066
00:39:16.741 --> 00:39:18.470
He's known to be a spy.

1067
00:39:18.743 --> 00:39:20.070
Why are you accusing him?

1068
00:39:20.244 --> 00:39:21.740
- I'm not accusing him. - Why are you doing that?

1069
00:39:21.746 --> 00:39:23.310
There are so many potential spies in your team.

1070
00:39:23.314 --> 00:39:25.310
- Seriously. - By the looks of them,

1071
00:39:25.316 --> 00:39:27.950
- Lee Teuk has to be the spy. - Wait, Irene.

1072
00:39:29.086 --> 00:39:30.880
Wait, Irene. Why are you looking at my bag?

1073
00:39:31.088 --> 00:39:32.490
Are you the spy?

1074
00:39:32.523 --> 00:39:34.950
- I saw your name tag. That's all. - Is that so?

1075
00:39:34.959 --> 00:39:36.160
(Chuckling)

1076
00:39:38.162 --> 00:39:40.730
- I think you might on our team. - Irene is...

1077
00:39:40.731 --> 00:39:42.600
- It looks like you want to join us, - No, no.

1078
00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:43.800
Irene seems very surprised.

1079
00:39:43.801 --> 00:39:45.160
- I like my team. - Look at her.

1080
00:39:45.202 --> 00:39:49.700
We will start Guess the Amount for the Race for Get-together Money.

1081
00:39:49.707 --> 00:39:51.340
- Guess the Amount. - Guess the Amount.

1082
00:39:51.475 --> 00:39:52.710
Guess the Amount.

1083
00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:55.370
Let me explain the game.

1084
00:39:55.379 --> 00:39:58.640
The winning team of this game will be taking the money.

1085
00:39:58.649 --> 00:40:01.810
Right now, Team Big Nose has the chance to play this game first.

1086
00:40:01.819 --> 00:40:03.720
You can choose the amount of money...

1087
00:40:03.721 --> 00:40:05.820
you'd want to take among the amounts you see on the panel.

1088
00:40:06.357 --> 00:40:08.520
If your opposing team guesses the correct amount of money,

1089
00:40:08.526 --> 00:40:11.060
you cannot take the money.

1090
00:40:11.796 --> 00:40:15.760
However, if the opposing team can't guess correctly, you get the money.

1091
00:40:16.934 --> 00:40:21.630
(In a nutshell, the opposing team must correctly guess the amount.)

1092
00:40:21.972 --> 00:40:25.040
However, if the opposing team fails to guess when the team takes...

1093
00:40:25.042 --> 00:40:27.740
an empty briefcase, they will get the half of opposing team's money.

1094
00:40:28.179 --> 00:40:31.740
(This is a mind game between the offense and defense.)

1095
00:40:31.749 --> 00:40:35.010
(Will Team Big Nose be able to take the get-together money?)

1096
00:40:35.019 --> 00:40:37.780
Please discuss it among yourselves, choose the amount you want,

1097
00:40:37.788 --> 00:40:39.120
and let us know.

1098
00:40:39.123 --> 00:40:41.620
So many of them are reckless. I'm sure they'll go with 25 dollars.

1099
00:40:41.625 --> 00:40:42.990
- Do we have to pull this out? - What?

1100
00:40:42.993 --> 00:40:44.660
Hey, let's go with the highest amount.

1101
00:40:44.662 --> 00:40:46.230
Let's choose 1 of these 2.

1102
00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:48.790
You want 25 dollars, but you'll go with 15 dollars to trick us.

1103
00:40:48.833 --> 00:40:50.500
But then, you will probably choose the empty briefcase to fool us.

1104
00:40:50.701 --> 00:40:51.800
Hold on.

1105
00:40:52.169 --> 00:40:53.530
Come to think of it,

1106
00:40:53.537 --> 00:40:54.870
- Their spy is among us. - The spy.

1107
00:40:54.872 --> 00:40:56.470
Hey, don't make any movements.

1108
00:40:56.474 --> 00:40:58.240
- Wait. You can't write it. - You can't.

1109
00:40:58.242 --> 00:41:00.240
- Why are you picking on me? - Kwang Soo.

1110
00:41:00.244 --> 00:41:02.240
- Why do you think it's me? - Kwang Soo is not the spy.

1111
00:41:02.313 --> 00:41:03.680
- It's because... - Let's go with the highest one.

1112
00:41:03.681 --> 00:41:05.340
Hey, spy. Listen up.

1113
00:41:05.583 --> 00:41:06.950
Here are the numbers.

1114
00:41:06.951 --> 00:41:10.220
These are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

1115
00:41:11.021 --> 00:41:12.590
- The head is number one? - You must be well-informed.

1116
00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:15.590
- These are 2, 3, 4, and 5. - So about the empty briefcase...

1117
00:41:17.161 --> 00:41:19.660
- Seok Jin pretends he's a spy. - The neck is number five.

1118
00:41:19.663 --> 00:41:21.560
He's trying to misinform us.

1119
00:41:21.565 --> 00:41:22.560
- That's what it was. - I agree.

1120
00:41:22.566 --> 00:41:23.760
- He's a strategist. - Right.

1121
00:41:23.768 --> 00:41:24.930
No one will believe him.

1122
00:41:24.935 --> 00:41:26.270
Don't even look at Seok Jin.

1123
00:41:26.337 --> 00:41:27.470
We won't consider him at all.

1124
00:41:28.639 --> 00:41:30.070
(Glancing)

1125
00:41:30.274 --> 00:41:31.740
I think they got the wind of this.

1126
00:41:31.742 --> 00:41:32.810
Really?

1127
00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:33.870
(Observing)

1128
00:41:33.878 --> 00:41:35.410
I think we should go with the big one.

1129
00:41:35.546 --> 00:41:37.580
- Big one? - What about the highest amount?

1130
00:41:37.648 --> 00:41:39.450
- Are you giving them signals? - No, no.

1131
00:41:40.184 --> 00:41:41.850
- You're looking at them. - Why are you looking at them?

1132
00:41:41.852 --> 00:41:44.350
- Why are you staring at them? - Why are you looking at them?

1133
00:41:44.355 --> 00:41:46.390
Jae Seok, don't be obvious. That's insulting.

1134
00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:47.720
When did I give them a signal?

1135
00:41:47.725 --> 00:41:49.490
- Don't make it obvious. - Hey.

1136
00:41:49.894 --> 00:41:51.160
- Why are you giving them a signal? - Hey.

1137
00:41:51.162 --> 00:41:52.420
There's no way I'd do that.

1138
00:41:52.429 --> 00:41:53.930
If I were a spy, would I make it look so obvious like this?

1139
00:41:53.931 --> 00:41:55.160
I can see right through you.

1140
00:41:55.166 --> 00:41:57.060
- Don't do it. Are we jokes to you? - Hey.

1141
00:41:57.067 --> 00:41:58.760
- This is driving me crazy. - Can we arrest him now?

1142
00:41:58.769 --> 00:42:00.200
- Unbelievable. - We have to do it later, right?

1143
00:42:00.204 --> 00:42:01.370
This is insane.

1144
00:42:01.939 --> 00:42:03.140
- All right. - Did you come to an agreement?

1145
00:42:03.374 --> 00:42:04.540
Yes.

1146
00:42:05.209 --> 00:42:07.240
The spy is carrying the briefcase.

1147
00:42:07.244 --> 00:42:09.140
(Will Team Hare and Tortoise guess the right amount?)

1148
00:42:09.313 --> 00:42:12.180
(It's time for them to guess the amount. Why are they hesitating?)

1149
00:42:12.183 --> 00:42:13.250
All right.

1150
00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:14.950
(Hey, it's the 4th one.)

1151
00:42:14.952 --> 00:42:16.680
The defending team must pay.

1152
00:42:16.687 --> 00:42:19.180
(Guys, it's the 3rd one.)

1153
00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:21.720
(I'm the spy. Let's go with number 3.)

1154
00:42:21.892 --> 00:42:24.920
- Hey, I'm sorry to point this out, - This is annoying.

1155
00:42:25.062 --> 00:42:27.260
- everyone is giving us a signal. - What are we supposed to do?

1156
00:42:27.264 --> 00:42:28.990
(They're all giving us a signal.)

1157
00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:30.930
- How can everyone give us a sign? - Everyone is doing it.

1158
00:42:30.935 --> 00:42:33.300
(Everyone is using their facial muscles too much.)

1159
00:42:33.537 --> 00:42:35.730
So Min, how many times did you change the number?

1160
00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:37.570
Why don't you use the sign language?

1161
00:42:37.641 --> 00:42:40.570
(Who is the real spy among the many copycats?)

1162
00:42:40.644 --> 00:42:41.770
Are you the spy?

1163
00:42:41.912 --> 00:42:45.440
My goodness! Jae Seok is really acting strange.

1164
00:42:45.449 --> 00:42:46.910
It's Jae Seok, the ultimate spy.

1165
00:42:47.051 --> 00:42:49.110
Jae Seok is the ultimate spy.

1166
00:42:49.353 --> 00:42:50.420
Really?

1167
00:42:50.421 --> 00:42:52.720
- The ultimate spy? - We'll go with Jae Seok.

1168
00:42:52.723 --> 00:42:54.890
You trust him despite the fact that he's acting strange?

1169
00:42:55.492 --> 00:42:56.760
- Are you doing that on purpose? - He's the one.

1170
00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:58.990
- This is all for an act. - Really? So you trust him?

1171
00:42:58.996 --> 00:43:01.160
- You know how spies... - He gave me a sign.

1172
00:43:01.165 --> 00:43:03.600
pretend to be dumb? That's what spies do.

1173
00:43:03.601 --> 00:43:06.270
He's not pretending. He's just dumb by nature.

1174
00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:07.870
(Kwang Soo claims this isn't for a show.)

1175
00:43:07.872 --> 00:43:09.770
- How could you do that? - I'm dumb?

1176
00:43:09.773 --> 00:43:10.870
It's because it's strange.

1177
00:43:10.875 --> 00:43:12.840
- All right. - Look at him.

1178
00:43:13.644 --> 00:43:16.010
(Did Haha and Dong Hae find an important clue?)

1179
00:43:16.013 --> 00:43:17.780
- Jong Kook. - He's making it too obvious.

1180
00:43:17.815 --> 00:43:19.010
- Come here. - What did you see?

1181
00:43:19.016 --> 00:43:20.410
Irene, stay there for a moment.

1182
00:43:20.417 --> 00:43:22.010
(Only real members of our team are invited.)

1183
00:43:22.119 --> 00:43:23.720
- Why? - What are you doing?

1184
00:43:24.188 --> 00:43:25.380
- What are you doing? - Come.

1185
00:43:25.389 --> 00:43:26.490
Irene is our spy.

1186
00:43:26.490 --> 00:43:28.490
- That's mean. They can't do that. - No, I'm not a spy.

1187
00:43:28.492 --> 00:43:30.660
If you do that, then we'll only look at Irene.

1188
00:43:30.761 --> 00:43:32.520
(Irene is left alone.)

1189
00:43:32.563 --> 00:43:34.260
Listen to what they say if you're a spy.

1190
00:43:34.265 --> 00:43:36.100
- Why aren't you listening? - Why are you standing there?

1191
00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:37.560
Why aren't you listening?

1192
00:43:37.568 --> 00:43:39.670
If you're a spy, listen to what they say and tell us.

1193
00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:41.230
- Confuse them. - Yes.

1194
00:43:41.238 --> 00:43:42.470
Irene.

1195
00:43:42.473 --> 00:43:44.370
Give us some information.

1196
00:43:44.375 --> 00:43:45.900
I'm on this team.

1197
00:43:46.543 --> 00:43:47.910
Give us information.

1198
00:43:48.145 --> 00:43:49.170
She's definitely a spy.

1199
00:43:49.179 --> 00:43:51.180
- She's on our team, right? - She's on our team.

1200
00:43:51.181 --> 00:43:53.650
- She sounded unnatural. - She's on our team.

1201
00:43:53.651 --> 00:43:55.610
(Discussing)

1202
00:43:58.289 --> 00:43:59.290
(Jae Seok shows 3 fingers.)

1203
00:43:59.290 --> 00:44:01.220
Jae Seok, that's not how you do it.

1204
00:44:01.492 --> 00:44:03.460
(What is he doing?)

1205
00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:05.160
- Do it secretly. - That's not how you do it.

1206
00:44:05.162 --> 00:44:06.590
Don't make it so obvious.

1207
00:44:07.064 --> 00:44:08.860
- Stop it. - Should we change it?

1208
00:44:08.999 --> 00:44:10.430
- Gosh. - Change what?

1209
00:44:10.601 --> 00:44:12.360
- Se Chan, you'll see. - Can we change this?

1210
00:44:12.369 --> 00:44:14.170
(It's 4.)

1211
00:44:14.171 --> 00:44:16.370
They changed it around. I'm certain of it.

1212
00:44:16.373 --> 00:44:17.470
A moment ago...

1213
00:44:17.474 --> 00:44:19.510
(Who is the real spy?)

1214
00:44:19.743 --> 00:44:21.240
All right. We'll trust our spy.

1215
00:44:21.245 --> 00:44:23.910
- What do you choose? - We'll trust our spy, Jae Seok.

1216
00:44:23.914 --> 00:44:25.280
(Will they trust Jae Seok and choose number 3?)

1217
00:44:25.282 --> 00:44:28.380
- Number 3? - Okay. Number 3.

1218
00:44:28.719 --> 00:44:30.020
(Suddenly)

1219
00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:31.780
- 1. - 2.

1220
00:44:31.789 --> 00:44:32.790
3.

1221
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:34.190
(1, 2, 3)

1222
00:44:34.191 --> 00:44:37.160
What are you doing?

1223
00:44:37.161 --> 00:44:39.390
- What did you do? - Why would you do that?

1224
00:44:39.396 --> 00:44:41.930
- What did he do? - I love it. That was clever.

1225
00:44:41.932 --> 00:44:43.930
- Why are they choosing number 3? - It's number 3.

1226
00:44:44.034 --> 00:44:45.200
Really?

1227
00:44:45.869 --> 00:44:47.600
Let's trust Jae Seok, and choose number three.

1228
00:44:47.604 --> 00:44:49.370
- Number three? - Yes.

1229
00:44:49.373 --> 00:44:52.140
- 1, 2, 3. Number 3. - Number 3.

1230
00:44:52.142 --> 00:44:53.540
(If Jae Seok is a spy, the defense team will keep their money.)

1231
00:44:53.544 --> 00:44:56.810
Please open the suitcase.

1232
00:44:56.814 --> 00:44:58.080
(If he is not, they'll lose their money.)

1233
00:44:58.082 --> 00:44:59.610
- I'm jealous. - So am I.

1234
00:44:59.650 --> 00:45:00.850
They found the spy at once.

1235
00:45:00.851 --> 00:45:05.350
(Is it really 20 dollars as Jae Seok said?)

1236
00:45:05.356 --> 00:45:09.490
(What's the result?)

1237
00:45:13.263 --> 00:45:14.660
- Yes! - Number four!

1238
00:45:14.665 --> 00:45:17.130
(It was number 4, 25 dollars.)

1239
00:45:17.434 --> 00:45:20.770
(Jae Seok's strategy worked.)

1240
00:45:20.771 --> 00:45:22.700
- Give us 25 dollars. - Give us 25 dollars.

1241
00:45:22.706 --> 00:45:25.740
(When Jae Seok looked stupid, he wasn't acting.)

1242
00:45:25.743 --> 00:45:27.410
- Hold on. - By the way...

1243
00:45:27.411 --> 00:45:29.070
- Those two... - Wasn't Kwang Soo acting strange?

1244
00:45:29.079 --> 00:45:31.410
Kwang Soo was doing this.

1245
00:45:31.415 --> 00:45:33.180
So Min too.

1246
00:45:33.183 --> 00:45:34.280
(Did Kwang Soo and So Min send them a signal?)

1247
00:45:34.818 --> 00:45:36.220
(5 minutes ago)

1248
00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:38.350
- It's so hard. - If they choose the wrong one...

1249
00:45:38.355 --> 00:45:39.890
(What?)

1250
00:45:42.493 --> 00:45:46.660
(They both showed 4 fingers.)

1251
00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:50.430
(Kwang Soo did it many times.)

1252
00:45:51.101 --> 00:45:53.070
- They were... - Kwang Soo was...

1253
00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:55.470
When they were going to choose number three...

1254
00:45:55.472 --> 00:45:56.640
- Like this? - Did you hear it?

1255
00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:59.810
It's because they wouldn't think I was a spy.

1256
00:45:59.810 --> 00:46:01.110
Is it true?

1257
00:46:01.111 --> 00:46:03.910
They didn't think I was a spy, that's why I showed four.

1258
00:46:03.914 --> 00:46:05.180
- What about you? - Me too.

1259
00:46:05.182 --> 00:46:07.580
I saw clearly,

1260
00:46:07.584 --> 00:46:08.950
when we opened the suitcase,

1261
00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:11.020
So Min wasn't happy.

1262
00:46:11.021 --> 00:46:12.120
(So Min wasn't happy when they won.)

1263
00:46:12.122 --> 00:46:14.120
(When they opened the suitcase...)

1264
00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:20.060
(She didn't smile right away.)

1265
00:46:20.064 --> 00:46:22.630
(She doesn't sound sincere.)

1266
00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:24.530
I was happy.

1267
00:46:25.269 --> 00:46:28.300
Team Hare and Tortoise's defense failed.

1268
00:46:28.739 --> 00:46:31.400
- Team Big Nose has 85 dollars. - So Min is not a spy.

1269
00:46:31.408 --> 00:46:33.740
Team Hare and Tortoise has 35 dollars.

1270
00:46:34.144 --> 00:46:37.510
(Which team will win money in the next round?)

1271
00:46:38.449 --> 00:46:39.850
(The next round takes place on a track.)

1272
00:46:39.850 --> 00:46:41.680
You fall into the water.

1273
00:46:42.286 --> 00:46:44.120
- It's water. - What's that?

1274
00:46:44.354 --> 00:46:45.620
- Are we falling into the water? - What's that?

1275
00:46:45.622 --> 00:46:47.590
- We're falling into the water? - Gosh.

1276
00:46:48.058 --> 00:46:50.260
- Are we falling into the water? - We're falling into the water.

1277
00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:51.590
(7 platforms, a mini pool, and a conveyor belt)

1278
00:46:52.496 --> 00:46:55.990
The second mission for Race for Get-together Money is...

1279
00:46:55.999 --> 00:46:57.660
While You're Busy.

1280
00:46:57.668 --> 00:46:59.870
(While You're Busy)

1281
00:46:59.870 --> 00:47:02.570
You play dibidibidip against seven people.

1282
00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:05.870
While a member of the offense team plays,

1283
00:47:05.876 --> 00:47:08.510
a member of the same team sits on the conveyor belt...

1284
00:47:08.679 --> 00:47:10.810
while it moves towards the pool.

1285
00:47:10.814 --> 00:47:12.080
(The player has to save the one on the conveyor belt.)

1286
00:47:12.082 --> 00:47:14.780
You must beat all seven opponents before your team member falls in,

1287
00:47:14.785 --> 00:47:17.550
run to the conveyor belt, and take the cushion away.

1288
00:47:18.889 --> 00:47:21.190
Another member will take over.

1289
00:47:21.191 --> 00:47:24.720
Every time someone is saved, the conveyor belt will speed up..

1290
00:47:24.728 --> 00:47:26.430
(The speed of the conveyor belt will increase.)

1291
00:47:26.497 --> 00:47:29.290
To win, you have to save more members than the other team.

1292
00:47:29.299 --> 00:47:32.700
The winners will gain the right to attack in Guess the Amount.

1293
00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:35.470
(Round 1, Offense: Team Big Nose Defense: Team Hare and Tortoise)

1294
00:47:35.472 --> 00:47:36.540
Let's do this!

1295
00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:37.640
- Let's go! - Let's finish this in one try!

1296
00:47:37.641 --> 00:47:38.970
We'll cheer for you.

1297
00:47:38.976 --> 00:47:41.540
(Joy will play dibidibidip. Kwang Soo sits on the belt.)

1298
00:47:41.545 --> 00:47:43.140
- Joy, focus. - Ready.

1299
00:47:43.147 --> 00:47:47.050
(Joy has to beat all 7 opponents...)

1300
00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:51.520
(and save Kwang Soo before he falls into the water.)

1301
00:47:52.189 --> 00:47:53.320
Dibidibidip.

1302
00:47:53.524 --> 00:47:54.890
Joy, hurry. Don't laugh.

1303
00:47:54.892 --> 00:47:56.390
(Kwang Soo is moving towards the pool.)

1304
00:47:56.793 --> 00:47:58.820
(Dibidibidip)

1305
00:47:59.329 --> 00:48:01.890
- You have no time for laughing. - You have no time for laughing.

1306
00:48:02.566 --> 00:48:03.700
Hurry.

1307
00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:05.200
I'm almost there.

1308
00:48:05.269 --> 00:48:07.670
(Fussing)

1309
00:48:07.871 --> 00:48:09.470
I can feel the cold.

1310
00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:12.740
(Joy is struggling.)

1311
00:48:13.377 --> 00:48:15.670
I think she's taking time on purpose.

1312
00:48:16.146 --> 00:48:19.510
(If Joy is a spy, she should take time.)

1313
00:48:20.184 --> 00:48:21.710
(Kwang Soo is approaching the pool.)

1314
00:48:21.718 --> 00:48:23.050
- Good. - Two more to go.

1315
00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:25.180
- Please! - Dibidibidip.

1316
00:48:25.189 --> 00:48:27.720
(Please save me!)

1317
00:48:27.724 --> 00:48:30.220
(She just needs to beat Haha.)

1318
00:48:30.761 --> 00:48:32.390
(Kwang Soo falls in.)

1319
00:48:32.396 --> 00:48:33.890
Please!

1320
00:48:34.298 --> 00:48:36.930
(Just when Joy beats Haha, Kwang Soo falls in.)

1321
00:48:38.936 --> 00:48:41.870
(Why does this always happen to Kwang Soo?)

1322
00:48:42.706 --> 00:48:46.240
(They can feel the cold.)

1323
00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:47.610
My goodness.

1324
00:48:48.679 --> 00:48:51.040
Is this iced water?

1325
00:48:51.048 --> 00:48:52.240
It is.

1326
00:48:54.184 --> 00:48:57.220
- I'm sorry. - Forget it.

1327
00:48:57.221 --> 00:48:58.720
(Cold)

1328
00:48:58.722 --> 00:48:59.790
You're a spy.

1329
00:48:59.790 --> 00:49:01.720
- I did my best. - Joy.

1330
00:49:01.725 --> 00:49:04.360
(Joy was acting suspiciously.)

1331
00:49:05.429 --> 00:49:06.530
(Laughing)

1332
00:49:07.064 --> 00:49:10.600
(She was so relaxed.)

1333
00:49:12.169 --> 00:49:13.300
(Sighing)

1334
00:49:13.704 --> 00:49:16.970
(She sighed when she succeeded.)

1335
00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:20.610
(Is Joy a spy?)

1336
00:49:20.711 --> 00:49:22.410
Jae Seok, you should fall into the water too.

1337
00:49:22.412 --> 00:49:23.910
Ready.

1338
00:49:23.914 --> 00:49:26.950
Should Joy continue?

1339
00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:28.950
- Let me try. - No.

1340
00:49:28.952 --> 00:49:30.220
- Let me try. - Let me try.

1341
00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:31.350
- Let me try. - I'll try.

1342
00:49:31.355 --> 00:49:32.450
- Eun Hyuk should try. - Let me try.

1343
00:49:32.456 --> 00:49:33.620
- Eun Hyuk should try. - Please.

1344
00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:35.290
- Let me try. - Eun Hyuk should try.

1345
00:49:35.292 --> 00:49:37.060
- Eun Hyuk should try. - Please.

1346
00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:38.890
I fell into the water. Let me try!

1347
00:49:39.496 --> 00:49:40.490
Joy.

1348
00:49:40.497 --> 00:49:41.890
No one cares about me!

1349
00:49:41.898 --> 00:49:43.430
(He fell in, but no one cares.)

1350
00:49:43.433 --> 00:49:45.860
- I'll try. - Eun Hyuk, beat them all.

1351
00:49:46.203 --> 00:49:48.470
I'll catch their movement.

1352
00:49:48.739 --> 00:49:50.240
- Let's go. - I'll show you.

1353
00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:52.700
Ready, set...

1354
00:49:53.977 --> 00:49:55.870
- Dibidibidip. - It's so fast.

1355
00:49:56.813 --> 00:49:58.140
(The speed has increased.)

1356
00:49:58.181 --> 00:50:00.280
- Dibidibidip. - It's so fast.

1357
00:50:00.350 --> 00:50:02.450
- Dibidibidip. - He's bad.

1358
00:50:02.853 --> 00:50:04.620
(We're doomed.)

1359
00:50:04.721 --> 00:50:06.220
It's moving so fast.

1360
00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:08.520
- Dibidibidip. - You shouldn't be slower than me.

1361
00:50:08.525 --> 00:50:09.620
(He fails every time.)

1362
00:50:09.626 --> 00:50:11.290
- Eun Hyuk. - Dibidibidip.

1363
00:50:11.295 --> 00:50:12.790
You're slower than me.

1364
00:50:12.796 --> 00:50:14.730
(He's so bad.)

1365
00:50:15.265 --> 00:50:17.300
(Angry)

1366
00:50:18.101 --> 00:50:19.430
You're slower than me.

1367
00:50:19.770 --> 00:50:21.970
(Jae Seok gives up.)

1368
00:50:22.372 --> 00:50:23.570
You're slower than me.

1369
00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:25.700
(He can't believe it.)

1370
00:50:25.909 --> 00:50:27.840
(Jae Seok falls in.)

1371
00:50:28.578 --> 00:50:30.610
(Eun Hyuk is trying so hard.)

1372
00:50:31.415 --> 00:50:32.680
He's a spy.

1373
00:50:32.849 --> 00:50:34.510
- He's a spy. - Eun Hyuk.

1374
00:50:34.518 --> 00:50:36.210
- The thing is... - He's a spy.

1375
00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:39.790
(He can't be this bad.)

1376
00:50:40.724 --> 00:50:42.220
(Was it you?)

1377
00:50:42.225 --> 00:50:43.760
- It was so obvious. - It showed.

1378
00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:45.090
You're a spy!

1379
00:50:45.162 --> 00:50:47.160
- Eun Hyuk. - It's not true.

1380
00:50:47.164 --> 00:50:48.790
It's so obvious.

1381
00:50:48.799 --> 00:50:50.160
I can't believe this.

1382
00:50:50.167 --> 00:50:52.030
(They have a good reason to suspect him.)

1383
00:50:52.035 --> 00:50:54.070
(30 minutes ago, they were practicing.)

1384
00:50:54.071 --> 00:50:56.370
- Dibidibidip. - Eun Hyuk is good.

1385
00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:58.570
- Dibidibidip. - Eun Hyuk is good.

1386
00:50:59.543 --> 00:51:00.540
How do you do that?

1387
00:51:00.544 --> 00:51:01.610
(Tell me.)

1388
00:51:01.611 --> 00:51:04.880
(He was considered an ace.)

1389
00:51:05.148 --> 00:51:08.080
(In the real game, he was so bad.)

1390
00:51:08.085 --> 00:51:11.220
(He was laughed at.)

1391
00:51:11.221 --> 00:51:13.890
(Even when he succeeded,)

1392
00:51:13.890 --> 00:51:16.660
(he continued.)

1393
00:51:17.361 --> 00:51:21.390
(They have no choice but to suspect him.)

1394
00:51:22.299 --> 00:51:24.930
- You try. - Let me try.

1395
00:51:25.435 --> 00:51:27.330
I did my best.

1396
00:51:27.337 --> 00:51:30.070
- I'll show you how to play. - You were so good earlier.

1397
00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:32.240
Try. It's really...

1398
00:51:32.242 --> 00:51:34.410
- Eun Hyuk. It was too... - Trust me.

1399
00:51:34.411 --> 00:51:36.040
I trust you.

1400
00:51:36.046 --> 00:51:37.580
- I'm disappointed. - I trust Seok Jin.

1401
00:51:37.581 --> 00:51:38.640
You're suspicious.

1402
00:51:38.648 --> 00:51:40.080
- I'll show you. Let's go. - Let's go.

1403
00:51:40.083 --> 00:51:43.850
This game was invented on a show he hosted.

1404
00:51:43.854 --> 00:51:45.780
- That's right. - He's the father of this game.

1405
00:51:46.590 --> 00:51:49.490
(Dibidibidip was invented on "Six Heroines".)

1406
00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:53.590
(Seok Jin was the host of the show.)

1407
00:51:54.297 --> 00:51:57.500
(Let me show you the original way.)

1408
00:51:57.501 --> 00:52:00.970
(Seok Jin was there when dibidibidip was invented.)

1409
00:52:01.571 --> 00:52:03.740
- Ready. - Please.

1410
00:52:04.875 --> 00:52:07.740
(Dibidibidip)

1411
00:52:07.744 --> 00:52:10.680
Dibidibidip.

1412
00:52:12.182 --> 00:52:13.550
He's bad.

1413
00:52:13.817 --> 00:52:15.680
Get ready.

1414
00:52:16.353 --> 00:52:18.850
(You said you invented this game.)

1415
00:52:18.855 --> 00:52:21.890
(He's doing his best.)

1416
00:52:21.892 --> 00:52:24.360
(He beats Se Chan.)

1417
00:52:24.361 --> 00:52:25.660
It's over.

1418
00:52:26.563 --> 00:52:27.930
It's over.

1419
00:52:27.931 --> 00:52:29.490
What? Continue.

1420
00:52:29.833 --> 00:52:31.700
(What? Continue.)

1421
00:52:31.701 --> 00:52:33.160
I lost.

1422
00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:35.870
(Is he a spy?)

1423
00:52:36.206 --> 00:52:40.010
(Seok Jin loses his focus.)

1424
00:52:41.478 --> 00:52:44.110
(What should we do?)

1425
00:52:44.281 --> 00:52:46.610
(Teuk gives up.)

1426
00:52:47.684 --> 00:52:48.950
(Seok Jin fails as predicted.)

1427
00:52:48.952 --> 00:52:50.450
I can't believe him.

1428
00:52:51.121 --> 00:52:54.820
(I can see all your movements.)

1429
00:52:54.858 --> 00:52:57.260
We should write, "spy", on him.

1430
00:52:57.260 --> 00:52:58.920
Even when he succeeded, he wouldn't move.

1431
00:52:58.929 --> 00:53:01.560
He just continued.

1432
00:53:01.565 --> 00:53:03.660
(Everyone wishes he was a spy.)

1433
00:53:03.934 --> 00:53:07.200
(I'll show you my ability next time.)

1434
00:53:07.204 --> 00:53:10.570
(All three members of Team Big Nose have failed.)

1435
00:53:10.874 --> 00:53:14.140
Dong Hae must be a spy.

1436
00:53:14.144 --> 00:53:15.870
(Is Dong Hae a spy?)

1437
00:53:15.879 --> 00:53:17.010
He lost at once.

1438
00:53:17.013 --> 00:53:18.680
- Dong Hae... - He lost at once every time.

1439
00:53:18.682 --> 00:53:20.180
showed his position even before I was in front of him.

1440
00:53:20.684 --> 00:53:22.810
He must be a spy.

1441
00:53:22.819 --> 00:53:24.220
He raised his hand.

1442
00:53:24.221 --> 00:53:25.780
He took a position while I was on the way.

1443
00:53:25.789 --> 00:53:27.390
He's suspicious.

1444
00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:28.750
(Dong Hae has been acting suspiciously.)

1445
00:53:29.493 --> 00:53:30.560
- Doesn't it work? - Dibidibidip.

1446
00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:31.790
- Joy. - Hey.

1447
00:53:31.795 --> 00:53:33.290
(He loses in one try.)

1448
00:53:33.296 --> 00:53:37.430
(He moves one beat faster and groans too quickly.)

1449
00:53:37.567 --> 00:53:39.830
(As a spy, is Dong Hae losing on purpose?)

1450
00:53:39.836 --> 00:53:41.530
What was that? He's strange.

1451
00:53:41.538 --> 00:53:42.630
He keeps doing the same thing.

1452
00:53:42.639 --> 00:53:44.370
Let's switch places.

1453
00:53:44.374 --> 00:53:45.400
Okay.

1454
00:53:45.408 --> 00:53:47.010
- How can I do well? - What's the order?

1455
00:53:48.011 --> 00:53:49.570
(Round 2, Defense: Team Big Nose Offense: Team Hare and Tortoise)

1456
00:53:49.579 --> 00:53:51.110
- Go up. - Anyone should play.

1457
00:53:51.681 --> 00:53:53.180
- Who will go? - I'll play.

1458
00:53:53.683 --> 00:53:55.010
- Okay. - I'll tell you.

1459
00:53:55.085 --> 00:53:56.110
I'll fall in anyway.

1460
00:53:56.119 --> 00:53:58.620
The order is rock, scissors, and paper.

1461
00:53:58.622 --> 00:54:00.990
- Okay. - Listen carefully.

1462
00:54:01.091 --> 00:54:03.660
- It's rock, scissors, and paper. - Rock, scissors, and paper.

1463
00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:05.160
Let's go.

1464
00:54:05.629 --> 00:54:07.660
- This moves faster than you think. - Okay.

1465
00:54:07.664 --> 00:54:09.760
- Get ready. - You must play in one go.

1466
00:54:09.766 --> 00:54:10.900
Start.

1467
00:54:12.369 --> 00:54:14.600
It's faster than you think.

1468
00:54:14.604 --> 00:54:15.930
- Dibidibidip. - What?

1469
00:54:15.939 --> 00:54:17.740
- Dibidibidip. - That's good.

1470
00:54:17.741 --> 00:54:20.410
(He passes in one go.)

1471
00:54:20.410 --> 00:54:22.670
(He passes two.)

1472
00:54:22.679 --> 00:54:24.780
(He passes three.)

1473
00:54:24.781 --> 00:54:27.550
(Haha attacks successfully three consecutive times.)

1474
00:54:27.551 --> 00:54:30.520
- What? - Dibidibidip.

1475
00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:32.780
(Kwang Soo plays slowly.)

1476
00:54:32.789 --> 00:54:33.790
Look at him.

1477
00:54:33.790 --> 00:54:34.890
What's going on?

1478
00:54:34.891 --> 00:54:36.390
(Dibidibi...)

1479
00:54:36.393 --> 00:54:37.390
(He hits him.)

1480
00:54:37.394 --> 00:54:39.620
What was that for?

1481
00:54:39.629 --> 00:54:41.490
- What was that? - Why did you hit me?

1482
00:54:42.098 --> 00:54:43.700
You can't do that.

1483
00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:45.530
Make it go back.

1484
00:54:45.535 --> 00:54:47.170
(Let's play it again.)

1485
00:54:47.170 --> 00:54:48.730
Come on, Kwang Soo.

1486
00:54:48.738 --> 00:54:50.340
- You should keep going. - That's cheating.

1487
00:54:50.373 --> 00:54:52.340
- He played slowly on purpose. - No.

1488
00:54:52.509 --> 00:54:54.010
- You copied me. - Okay.

1489
00:54:54.010 --> 00:54:55.570
- Okay, go. - You must do it quickly.

1490
00:54:55.579 --> 00:54:57.580
- Get ready. - Come on, Kwang Soo.

1491
00:54:57.781 --> 00:55:00.510
Dibidibidip.

1492
00:55:00.517 --> 00:55:02.610
Hurry up, Haha.

1493
00:55:02.819 --> 00:55:04.780
- Dibidibidip. - Let's go, Haha.

1494
00:55:04.788 --> 00:55:06.350
- You got it. - Dibidibidip.

1495
00:55:06.356 --> 00:55:07.890
You almost got it, Haha.

1496
00:55:07.891 --> 00:55:08.890
Dibidibidip.

1497
00:55:08.892 --> 00:55:10.490
(You can do it, Haha.)

1498
00:55:10.493 --> 00:55:12.820
Haha, I'm almost there.

1499
00:55:12.829 --> 00:55:14.930
(She keeps defending.)

1500
00:55:14.931 --> 00:55:17.260
I'm almost there, Haha.

1501
00:55:17.267 --> 00:55:19.160
That's right.

1502
00:55:19.169 --> 00:55:22.870
(So Min defends well, and Haha fails.)

1503
00:55:23.974 --> 00:55:25.900
Kwang Soo was being so mean.

1504
00:55:26.543 --> 00:55:28.110
(That was such a dirty play.)

1505
00:55:28.511 --> 00:55:29.540
It was because of him.

1506
00:55:29.546 --> 00:55:30.910
- I couldn't help it. - What did you do?

1507
00:55:30.914 --> 00:55:32.240
I couldn't help it.

1508
00:55:32.248 --> 00:55:34.650
Kwang Soo is no longer the spy.

1509
00:55:34.651 --> 00:55:36.450
He's no longer a candidate.

1510
00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:37.820
What are you talking about?

1511
00:55:37.821 --> 00:55:39.720
I did it without realizing it.

1512
00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:41.290
All right, let's go.

1513
00:55:41.291 --> 00:55:43.290
I'm sorry, but I was so frustrated.

1514
00:55:43.293 --> 00:55:44.890
- Is that so? - Why are you crying?

1515
00:55:44.894 --> 00:55:46.390
- 1, 2... - Okay, let's go.

1516
00:55:46.630 --> 00:55:47.760
Get ready.

1517
00:55:47.764 --> 00:55:48.890
(Jong Kook plays while Ye Sung rides.)

1518
00:55:48.898 --> 00:55:49.990
Start.

1519
00:55:51.067 --> 00:55:53.130
Dibidibidip.

1520
00:55:53.703 --> 00:55:55.700
(He's too fast.)

1521
00:55:56.606 --> 00:55:57.940
- Dibidibidip. - He's too fast.

1522
00:55:57.941 --> 00:55:59.600
- He plays too fast. - Dibidibidip.

1523
00:55:59.609 --> 00:56:01.240
- He's too fast. - Dibidibidip.

1524
00:56:01.244 --> 00:56:02.640
(He pushes him off.)

1525
00:56:03.079 --> 00:56:04.780
(Dibidibi...)

1526
00:56:04.781 --> 00:56:05.780
(He pushes him off.)

1527
00:56:05.782 --> 00:56:07.080
Do it again.

1528
00:56:07.083 --> 00:56:08.180
- It's dibidibidip. - What was that?

1529
00:56:08.184 --> 00:56:10.450
- What happened? - Time out.

1530
00:56:10.453 --> 00:56:11.550
Start over.

1531
00:56:12.288 --> 00:56:13.890
- Seriously. - Start over.

1532
00:56:13.890 --> 00:56:15.890
- It's too fast. - He plays too fast.

1533
00:56:15.892 --> 00:56:17.060
We should start over.

1534
00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:18.890
I can't hear him. He's too fast.

1535
00:56:18.895 --> 00:56:21.390
- It doesn't count. - I can't understand you.

1536
00:56:21.398 --> 00:56:23.030
- Dibidibidip? I got it. - Stop.

1537
00:56:23.033 --> 00:56:24.300
Get ready.

1538
00:56:24.401 --> 00:56:26.030
- Say it clearly. - Start.

1539
00:56:26.036 --> 00:56:27.930
(Let's play fair.)

1540
00:56:27.937 --> 00:56:29.100
Dibidibidip.

1541
00:56:29.105 --> 00:56:31.570
(Why is he holding a fist?)

1542
00:56:31.941 --> 00:56:33.200
- Dibi... - What did you do?

1543
00:56:33.209 --> 00:56:35.140
- Dibidibidip. - You can't make a fist.

1544
00:56:35.145 --> 00:56:36.740
What are you doing?

1545
00:56:36.746 --> 00:56:37.780
(He doesn't care.)

1546
00:56:37.781 --> 00:56:39.340
What are you doing?

1547
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:42.110
- Dibidibidip. - Wait a minute.

1548
00:56:42.118 --> 00:56:45.580
(He makes ambiguous shapes.)

1549
00:56:45.588 --> 00:56:47.390
That's not acceptable.

1550
00:56:47.390 --> 00:56:48.790
- No way. - Wait.

1551
00:56:48.792 --> 00:56:51.160
Jong Kook did it first.

1552
00:56:51.161 --> 00:56:53.160
- What do you mean? - This is what he did.

1553
00:56:53.163 --> 00:56:55.160
- Start over. - Start over.

1554
00:56:55.165 --> 00:56:57.330
- Start over? - Jae Seok and Kwang Soo are warned.

1555
00:56:57.333 --> 00:56:59.460
- Start from the beginning. - Why are we warned?

1556
00:56:59.769 --> 00:57:01.100
Jong Kook made a fist.

1557
00:57:01.104 --> 00:57:04.340
Your judgment is biased.

1558
00:57:04.374 --> 00:57:05.570
You're Jong Kook's slave.

1559
00:57:07.243 --> 00:57:08.340
Start over.

1560
00:57:09.179 --> 00:57:10.810
- Let's play seriously. - Okay.

1561
00:57:10.814 --> 00:57:13.180
Let's start. Don't play too fast.

1562
00:57:13.183 --> 00:57:14.280
- Okay. - Get ready.

1563
00:57:14.751 --> 00:57:15.880
Start.

1564
00:57:16.619 --> 00:57:17.780
Dibidibidip.

1565
00:57:17.954 --> 00:57:20.390
(Jong Kook attacks successfully.)

1566
00:57:21.224 --> 00:57:22.650
(He passes the second player.)

1567
00:57:22.659 --> 00:57:26.090
(Next is Jae Seok's turn.)

1568
00:57:27.297 --> 00:57:31.000
My foot is asleep.

1569
00:57:31.101 --> 00:57:33.970
Time out. His foot is asleep.

1570
00:57:34.370 --> 00:57:35.700
My goodness.

1571
00:57:35.872 --> 00:57:37.370
He's being serious.

1572
00:57:37.373 --> 00:57:39.400
- Are you telling the truth? - Come on.

1573
00:57:39.409 --> 00:57:40.610
His foot is asleep.

1574
00:57:40.610 --> 00:57:42.970
- When did it happen? - Which foot is asleep?

1575
00:57:43.012 --> 00:57:44.380
I'll massage it you.

1576
00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:47.910
(Physical therapist Jong Kook tries to treat him.)

1577
00:57:47.917 --> 00:57:49.610
I'm sorry.

1578
00:57:49.619 --> 00:57:50.720
Which part is asleep?

1579
00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:52.580
- Which part? - I'm sorry.

1580
00:57:52.789 --> 00:57:54.690
We'll move you back.

1581
00:57:54.691 --> 00:57:55.990
Start from here.

1582
00:57:55.992 --> 00:57:57.490
Get ready, set, go.

1583
00:57:57.494 --> 00:57:59.490
(Round 2 resumes.)

1584
00:57:59.896 --> 00:58:01.390
- Okay. - Dibidibidip.

1585
00:58:01.397 --> 00:58:02.790
- What was that? - Dibidibidip.

1586
00:58:02.799 --> 00:58:06.360
- Dibidibidip. - That doesn't count.

1587
00:58:06.703 --> 00:58:13.200
(If he wins Eun Hyuk, he can save Ye Sung.)

1588
00:58:13.209 --> 00:58:14.410
Save him.

1589
00:58:14.410 --> 00:58:15.910
(He attacks successfully.)

1590
00:58:15.912 --> 00:58:18.080
- All right. - Okay.

1591
00:58:18.081 --> 00:58:20.150
(It's their first victory thanks to Jong Kook.)

1592
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:21.280
Great job.

1593
00:58:21.851 --> 00:58:23.450
He won again.

1594
00:58:23.453 --> 00:58:24.550
(He succeeds again.)

1595
00:58:25.121 --> 00:58:28.590
(Team Hare and Tortoise wins.)

1596
00:58:28.591 --> 00:58:30.890
- That was unfair. - We should have...

1597
00:58:30.894 --> 00:58:33.160
We could have done better.

1598
00:58:33.296 --> 00:58:34.790
- Right? - Goodness.

1599
00:58:34.798 --> 00:58:36.930
Team Hare and Tortoise is ahead.

1600
00:58:36.933 --> 00:58:38.330
Jong Kook and Haha should play.

1601
00:58:38.334 --> 00:58:40.270
- Okay. - Let's do that.

1602
00:58:40.670 --> 00:58:43.640
Haha, your team already won.

1603
00:58:43.873 --> 00:58:46.000
- You know what I mean? - You don't need to win again.

1604
00:58:47.143 --> 00:58:49.910
(Jong Kook is on the conveyor belt.)

1605
00:58:49.913 --> 00:58:52.940
(Falling in cold water is not a big deal.)

1606
00:58:54.450 --> 00:58:55.710
- You don't need to win again. - Get ready.

1607
00:58:55.718 --> 00:58:57.880
(Will Haha prevent Jong Kook from falling in the water?)

1608
00:58:58.454 --> 00:58:59.550
Start.

1609
00:58:59.789 --> 00:59:01.290
(Round 3 starts.)

1610
00:59:01.291 --> 00:59:03.560
- Dibidibidip. - Take your time.

1611
00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:05.360
Dibidibidip.

1612
00:59:05.728 --> 00:59:07.790
- Dibidibidip. - You're almost there.

1613
00:59:07.797 --> 00:59:09.590
- You're almost there. - Dibidibidip.

1614
00:59:10.166 --> 00:59:12.460
- Dibidibidip. - You're almost there.

1615
00:59:12.468 --> 00:59:14.570
(What fun! They're dancing.)

1616
00:59:15.205 --> 00:59:17.540
(It's performance art.)

1617
00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:18.640
My goodness.

1618
00:59:19.042 --> 00:59:20.640
What's wrong?

1619
00:59:20.643 --> 00:59:22.810
Two of you, come here.

1620
00:59:22.812 --> 00:59:24.640
Why?

1621
00:59:24.781 --> 00:59:25.940
I was working hard.

1622
00:59:27.350 --> 00:59:29.350
Have you lost your mind? Do it properly.

1623
00:59:29.352 --> 00:59:30.850
- What's wrong with you? - Start over.

1624
00:59:30.854 --> 00:59:32.880
- Will you do better? - Let's start over.

1625
00:59:33.089 --> 00:59:34.450
Do a better job.

1626
00:59:34.457 --> 00:59:36.650
Jae Seok plays well.

1627
00:59:36.659 --> 00:59:38.760
He's good on defense.

1628
00:59:39.262 --> 00:59:41.530
Attack and defense are different.

1629
00:59:41.764 --> 00:59:42.990
He was right there.

1630
00:59:42.999 --> 00:59:44.100
Get ready.

1631
00:59:44.601 --> 00:59:45.700
Start.

1632
00:59:46.369 --> 00:59:47.370
Dibidibidip.

1633
00:59:47.370 --> 00:59:49.230
(They both play fair.)

1634
00:59:49.239 --> 00:59:53.640
Dibidibidip.

1635
00:59:53.643 --> 00:59:56.010
(Kwang Soo takes his time.)

1636
00:59:56.913 --> 00:59:58.380
What is he doing?

1637
00:59:59.082 --> 01:00:01.080
- He lost. - I lost.

1638
01:00:01.084 --> 01:00:03.820
I lost, okay?

1639
01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:04.950
- He lost. - Go back.

1640
01:00:04.954 --> 01:00:06.620
Why did you jump?

1641
01:00:06.623 --> 01:00:08.220
It's because I'm cold.

1642
01:00:08.224 --> 01:00:10.790
- I'm cold. - My goodness.

1643
01:00:10.793 --> 01:00:12.260
He mistrusts us.

1644
01:00:12.262 --> 01:00:13.990
- By the way... - What's going on?

1645
01:00:13.997 --> 01:00:17.200
let's watch them play together.

1646
01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:19.860
Let's see if there's an end to their game.

1647
01:00:19.869 --> 01:00:21.870
- Will they play? - The two of you should play.

1648
01:00:21.871 --> 01:00:23.470
- We're doing it properly. - Try it.

1649
01:00:23.473 --> 01:00:25.140
- You should play. - What's wrong?

1650
01:00:25.141 --> 01:00:28.210
- Try it. - That's nonsense.

1651
01:00:28.211 --> 01:00:29.270
Dibidibidip.

1652
01:00:31.414 --> 01:00:33.680
(Two cheaters play against each other.)

1653
01:00:34.450 --> 01:00:37.080
(Here comes my attack.)

1654
01:00:37.086 --> 01:00:38.950
What are you doing?

1655
01:00:38.988 --> 01:00:41.620
- The winner will be determined. - We're just playing.

1656
01:00:41.624 --> 01:00:43.250
The winner will be determined.

1657
01:00:43.259 --> 01:00:45.260
- We're just playing. - They play the same.

1658
01:00:45.461 --> 01:00:48.160
- Are you better? - That's right.

1659
01:00:48.164 --> 01:00:49.760
Let's play again.

1660
01:00:49.766 --> 01:00:50.800
I'll be serious.

1661
01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:52.460
- Come on. - Do it properly.

1662
01:00:52.468 --> 01:00:53.560
Get ready.

1663
01:00:53.937 --> 01:00:54.970
Dibidibidip.

1664
01:00:54.971 --> 01:00:56.100
(He attacks Kwang Soo successfully.)

1665
01:00:56.105 --> 01:00:57.440
- He got it. - Dibidibidip.

1666
01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.740
(He attacks Seok Jin successfully.)

1667
01:00:58.741 --> 01:01:00.370
- He got it again. - Dibidibidip.

1668
01:01:00.376 --> 01:01:01.410
(So Min and Eun Hyuk remain.)

1669
01:01:05.748 --> 01:01:06.783
Dibidibidip.

1670
01:01:06.783 --> 01:01:07.917
(He attacks Kwang Soo successfully.)

1671
01:01:07.917 --> 01:01:09.252
- He got it. - Dibidibidip.

1672
01:01:09.252 --> 01:01:10.553
(He attacks Seok Jin successfully.)

1673
01:01:10.553 --> 01:01:12.188
- He got it again. - Dibidibidip.

1674
01:01:12.188 --> 01:01:13.222
(So Min and Eun Hyuk remain.)

1675
01:01:13.222 --> 01:01:14.223
- He got it again. - Dibidibidip.

1676
01:01:14.223 --> 01:01:15.692
- He got it. - Dibidibidip.

1677
01:01:15.692 --> 01:01:17.627
Dibidibidip.

1678
01:01:17.627 --> 01:01:19.629
- So Min is good. - She's doing well.

1679
01:01:19.629 --> 01:01:20.630
(She doesn't budge.)

1680
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:22.532
- So Min. - Come on.

1681
01:01:22.598 --> 01:01:24.100
Dibidibidip.

1682
01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:26.035
(So Min is doing well.)

1683
01:01:26.035 --> 01:01:28.705
(So Min defends herself 8 times.)

1684
01:01:28.705 --> 01:01:29.806
So Min.

1685
01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:33.476
(Jong Min falls in the water.)

1686
01:01:33.476 --> 01:01:36.012
(So Min is amazing at playing defense.)

1687
01:01:36.012 --> 01:01:37.780
That was great, So Min.

1688
01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:40.683
- Good job, So Min. - That was impressive.

1689
01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:42.852
- So Min was great. - She was.

1690
01:01:43.353 --> 01:01:46.222
Team Hare and Tortoise wins.

1691
01:01:46.222 --> 01:01:48.358
(The winner is Team Hare and Tortoise anyway.)

1692
01:01:48.358 --> 01:01:49.959
You win the prize.

1693
01:01:49.959 --> 01:01:51.728
We feel bad even after winning.

1694
01:01:51.728 --> 01:01:54.530
- I know. - That's true.

1695
01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:56.332
(The teams' fate will be determined in the final race.)

1696
01:01:56.933 --> 01:01:57.934
- Here it is. - What is it?

1697
01:01:57.934 --> 01:02:00.403
- Number four. - Okay.

1698
01:02:00.403 --> 01:02:04.040
The final race for Race for Get-together Money...

1699
01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:05.875
is Race With Bells.

1700
01:02:05.875 --> 01:02:08.578
(Race With Bells)

1701
01:02:09.112 --> 01:02:11.180
Is it a race with bells?

1702
01:02:11.681 --> 01:02:13.649
- It's been a while. - It's a race?

1703
01:02:13.649 --> 01:02:16.419
You have 15 minutes to attack.

1704
01:02:16.486 --> 01:02:19.455
The attacking team rips off the name tag of the defending team.

1705
01:02:19.856 --> 01:02:22.191
The defending team has to hide from them...

1706
01:02:22.191 --> 01:02:24.460
and find 100 dollars of get-together money.

1707
01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:26.062
There are 10 of them with 10 dollars each.

1708
01:02:26.396 --> 01:02:28.664
If the spy finds the money,

1709
01:02:28.664 --> 01:02:31.601
that amount is deducted from your total.

1710
01:02:31.601 --> 01:02:33.202
(If each team's spy finds the money, that amount is deducted from total.)

1711
01:02:33.336 --> 01:02:35.838
(The amount is deducted from the get-together money?)

1712
01:02:35.838 --> 01:02:37.073
If the spy finds it?

1713
01:02:37.473 --> 01:02:38.941
We have to look.

1714
01:02:39.475 --> 01:02:41.077
That's scary.

1715
01:02:41.644 --> 01:02:45.381
At the conclusion of the race, if you find the spy by majority vote,

1716
01:02:45.381 --> 01:02:48.851
you get 50 dollars extra.

1717
01:02:48.851 --> 01:02:49.952
This is big.

1718
01:02:50.253 --> 01:02:52.688
They're all acting weird, so it's hard to tell.

1719
01:02:52.688 --> 01:02:54.624
(The key is to find the hidden spy.)

1720
01:02:55.525 --> 01:02:56.759
(Will they be able to accumulate money and avoid the spy?)

1721
01:02:56.759 --> 01:02:58.561
I'm good at smelling money.

1722
01:02:59.062 --> 01:03:01.130
We have to find it.

1723
01:03:01.297 --> 01:03:03.066
You can't just keep hiding.

1724
01:03:03.066 --> 01:03:04.934
- You have to find the money. - That's right.

1725
01:03:04.934 --> 01:03:07.703
The spy will find the money and throw it away.

1726
01:03:07.703 --> 01:03:08.771
- That's right. - Right?

1727
01:03:08.771 --> 01:03:10.073
You answered.

1728
01:03:10.573 --> 01:03:12.375
Because I'm on TV.

1729
01:03:12.375 --> 01:03:14.143
I'm sorry,

1730
01:03:14.143 --> 01:03:15.845
but compared to when we started,

1731
01:03:16.245 --> 01:03:17.547
you look seriously ill.

1732
01:03:17.547 --> 01:03:18.881
(He looks somewhat darker.)

1733
01:03:19.549 --> 01:03:22.051
- Did my hair get flat? - Your lip color got lost.

1734
01:03:22.819 --> 01:03:24.854
Your lip is not red anymore.

1735
01:03:24.854 --> 01:03:26.622
- Your hair got flat. - It did?

1736
01:03:26.622 --> 01:03:29.392
Do I look old? That's no good.

1737
01:03:29.392 --> 01:03:30.393
(It was the ultraviolet light.)

1738
01:03:30.393 --> 01:03:31.894
I was hiding it.

1739
01:03:32.361 --> 01:03:34.497
Teuk doesn't...

1740
01:03:34.497 --> 01:03:36.032
do well outdoors.

1741
01:03:36.032 --> 01:03:37.200
He doesn't.

1742
01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:40.103
I've never seen his real lip color.

1743
01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:42.105
- I guess it's always this color. - Is it too violet?

1744
01:03:42.772 --> 01:03:45.141
I'm Kang Soo Jee.

1745
01:03:45.942 --> 01:03:50.246
- Good one. - He's really funny indoors.

1746
01:03:50.246 --> 01:03:51.481
He talks a lot when there's roof over him.

1747
01:03:51.481 --> 01:03:53.282
- We have the roof. - That was good.

1748
01:03:53.282 --> 01:03:55.351
- That was good, right? - We have to find the spy.

1749
01:03:56.652 --> 01:03:57.954
This is awesome.

1750
01:03:57.954 --> 01:04:00.490
(Meanwhile, Team Hare and Tortoise heads to the headquarters.)

1751
01:04:00.490 --> 01:04:02.792
- This is paradise for Jong Kook. - It is.

1752
01:04:02.792 --> 01:04:05.661
- This is insane. What's all this? - It's paradise.

1753
01:04:05.661 --> 01:04:07.363
This is paradise.

1754
01:04:07.363 --> 01:04:09.165
(It's full of workout equipment.)

1755
01:04:09.165 --> 01:04:11.601
Take a picture of this.

1756
01:04:11.801 --> 01:04:13.169
This is awesome.

1757
01:04:13.169 --> 01:04:14.704
(It's fitness facility for national-level athletes.)

1758
01:04:15.104 --> 01:04:16.472
This is a chest press machine.

1759
01:04:18.207 --> 01:04:20.543
- This is so nice. - He's so happy.

1760
01:04:21.244 --> 01:04:22.278
Is this paradise?

1761
01:04:22.278 --> 01:04:24.247
This is his amusement park.

1762
01:04:25.148 --> 01:04:27.083
This is so nice.

1763
01:04:27.083 --> 01:04:28.751
- Right? - Oh, dear.

1764
01:04:28.751 --> 01:04:30.052
(He doesn't care about the Name Tag Elimination anymore.)

1765
01:04:30.052 --> 01:04:31.721
Haha, check out the angle.

1766
01:04:31.721 --> 01:04:33.356
This one is really rare.

1767
01:04:33.923 --> 01:04:35.691
- This is new. - It's new?

1768
01:04:35.691 --> 01:04:39.562
This is awesome for working out the lower body.

1769
01:04:39.962 --> 01:04:42.431
We'll get started once you get your bells.

1770
01:04:42.899 --> 01:04:44.033
I'm scared.

1771
01:04:44.033 --> 01:04:46.602
I hope Eun Hyuk can distract them.

1772
01:04:46.602 --> 01:04:48.104
I'll try.

1773
01:04:48.104 --> 01:04:49.872
They can't catch you, so you can lure them.

1774
01:04:49.872 --> 01:04:51.507
I'll try to distract them.

1775
01:04:51.507 --> 01:04:54.143
We have to find out who the spy is in our team.

1776
01:04:54.243 --> 01:04:57.246
Do you win by having more money or having less people eliminated?

1777
01:04:57.580 --> 01:04:59.982
In the end, the team with more money wins.

1778
01:04:59.982 --> 01:05:01.684
So you have to have more money.

1779
01:05:01.751 --> 01:05:04.187
What adults say is true.

1780
01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:05.955
You need to have money when you're old.

1781
01:05:05.955 --> 01:05:07.223
Money is the best.

1782
01:05:07.790 --> 01:05:09.625
Stop saying weird things.

1783
01:05:09.625 --> 01:05:11.160
- Stop talking to yourself. - Okay.

1784
01:05:11.661 --> 01:05:14.230
Let's get started with the race.

1785
01:05:14.230 --> 01:05:16.933
- All right. - We can do this.

1786
01:05:16.933 --> 01:05:18.100
- We can do this. - We can do this.

1787
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:19.202
Let's do a team cheer.

1788
01:05:19.302 --> 01:05:20.870
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

1789
01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:22.038
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1790
01:05:22.505 --> 01:05:24.373
Don't forget about the spy.

1791
01:05:24.874 --> 01:05:27.343
We have to eliminate them as fast as possible.

1792
01:05:27.476 --> 01:05:29.812
- 5, 4, - How do we get out?

1793
01:05:30.279 --> 01:05:33.182
3, 2, 1.

1794
01:05:33.182 --> 01:05:34.183
Race starts.

1795
01:05:34.183 --> 01:05:36.352
- Start. - You have to be careful.

1796
01:05:36.419 --> 01:05:37.620
Race starts.

1797
01:05:37.687 --> 01:05:39.622
We have to go to the other building, right?

1798
01:05:39.622 --> 01:05:41.591
Are we going to eliminate the spy too?

1799
01:05:41.591 --> 01:05:43.626
Just eliminate everybody. It doesn't matter who they are.

1800
01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:45.728
Be careful.

1801
01:05:45.795 --> 01:05:46.996
Be careful once you get outside.

1802
01:05:46.996 --> 01:05:48.631
They must have this there too.

1803
01:05:49.832 --> 01:05:51.500
Let's run. We have no time.

1804
01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:53.102
How do we catch them?

1805
01:05:53.603 --> 01:05:56.005
Box, box...

1806
01:05:56.005 --> 01:05:57.473
(There are 10 small boxes with 10 dollars each.)

1807
01:05:57.640 --> 01:06:01.143
(They must find it quickly to add to the get-together money.)

1808
01:06:02.211 --> 01:06:04.480
(Jingle)

1809
01:06:05.081 --> 01:06:07.149
I hear the bell. It's the bell.

1810
01:06:07.583 --> 01:06:08.851
It's the bell.

1811
01:06:08.985 --> 01:06:10.553
Where? From where?

1812
01:06:10.586 --> 01:06:11.721
From where?

1813
01:06:13.789 --> 01:06:15.992
- There they are. - Go up there.

1814
01:06:16.592 --> 01:06:19.328
Go outside. Corner them to there.

1815
01:06:19.629 --> 01:06:20.763
What do we do?

1816
01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:22.565
(They're frightened.)

1817
01:06:22.565 --> 01:06:24.100
- Hey. - Let's hide.

1818
01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:25.801
(They're coming. Let's hide.)

1819
01:06:27.570 --> 01:06:30.473
(We heard them near here.)

1820
01:06:32.942 --> 01:06:36.479
Please let me go. Just this time.

1821
01:06:36.479 --> 01:06:37.780
(She was hiding in the other team's headquarters.)

1822
01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:40.082
Please let me go. I could be the spy.

1823
01:06:40.082 --> 01:06:41.317
Just this time.

1824
01:06:41.317 --> 01:06:43.753
My cameraman was so slow.

1825
01:06:43.753 --> 01:06:45.688
- I already saw you. - What's wrong?

1826
01:06:45.688 --> 01:06:47.256
I can't trust anybody.

1827
01:06:47.256 --> 01:06:48.491
Don't be like this.

1828
01:06:48.491 --> 01:06:50.092
- I'll find it. - We can't let her go, right?

1829
01:06:50.092 --> 01:06:51.727
Tell me who the spy is on your team.

1830
01:06:51.727 --> 01:06:54.730
The spy? I think... I'll tell you, so please let me go.

1831
01:06:54.730 --> 01:06:56.532
- Okay. - You can rip it later.

1832
01:06:56.532 --> 01:06:58.601
- There are two candidates. - Who?

1833
01:06:58.601 --> 01:07:00.603
Eun Hyuk or Lee Teuk.

1834
01:07:00.603 --> 01:07:02.204
(She thinks it's either Eun Hyuk or Lee Teuk.)

1835
01:07:02.872 --> 01:07:05.041
Come on, Ye Sung.

1836
01:07:05.041 --> 01:07:06.342
- We shouldn't let her go. - Ye Sung.

1837
01:07:06.542 --> 01:07:10.112
Ye Sung, please let me go.

1838
01:07:10.413 --> 01:07:12.782
Ye Sung, I...

1839
01:07:12.782 --> 01:07:14.350
(She lies down.)

1840
01:07:15.151 --> 01:07:16.285
Who's that?

1841
01:07:17.553 --> 01:07:18.821
They're there.

1842
01:07:20.389 --> 01:07:21.490
They're over there.

1843
01:07:22.391 --> 01:07:23.592
Why are they gathered there?

1844
01:07:27.063 --> 01:07:28.731
Watch her. I'll get going.

1845
01:07:28.731 --> 01:07:30.099
They came in.

1846
01:07:30.533 --> 01:07:32.234
- They just came in. - Can I go?

1847
01:07:32.234 --> 01:07:34.303
- Just this time. - So Min.

1848
01:07:34.937 --> 01:07:37.073
(I'm coming to get you.)

1849
01:07:38.274 --> 01:07:40.743
(I can't get caught now.)

1850
01:07:43.145 --> 01:07:45.514
(I'm following you until the end.)

1851
01:07:45.581 --> 01:07:46.682
He's coming.

1852
01:07:46.682 --> 01:07:48.084
(When are you going to stop?)

1853
01:07:48.084 --> 01:07:51.120
(Se Chan spots Kwang Soo running away.)

1854
01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:53.689
(He plans to corner him and catch him.)

1855
01:07:53.689 --> 01:07:54.857
Corner him.

1856
01:07:55.291 --> 01:07:56.292
Corner him.

1857
01:07:56.292 --> 01:07:58.227
(You're going to corner me?)

1858
01:07:58.227 --> 01:07:59.462
(He changes direction.)

1859
01:08:00.262 --> 01:08:01.530
(Dashing)

1860
01:08:01.530 --> 01:08:04.800
(Kwang Soo is gone, and Seok Jin is left behind.)

1861
01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:06.102
Go, Kwang Soo.

1862
01:08:06.102 --> 01:08:07.703
- Rip it. - Go, Kwang Soo.

1863
01:08:07.703 --> 01:08:09.305
(Ripping)

1864
01:08:10.773 --> 01:08:12.742
I saved Kwang Soo.

1865
01:08:13.976 --> 01:08:15.044
I...

1866
01:08:15.044 --> 01:08:16.412
(Seok Jin is out.)

1867
01:08:16.412 --> 01:08:17.780
I saved Kwang Soo.

1868
01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:20.516
Kwang Soo, please do my share!

1869
01:08:23.085 --> 01:08:25.454
Wait... Hold on.

1870
01:08:26.255 --> 01:08:28.557
Where do I find it? This place is huge.

1871
01:08:29.859 --> 01:08:31.327
This place is huge.

1872
01:08:32.061 --> 01:08:34.163
(Is that Eun Hyuk?)

1873
01:08:35.331 --> 01:08:38.868
(The hunt begins.)

1874
01:08:40.603 --> 01:08:41.871
He's fast.

1875
01:08:41.871 --> 01:08:44.507
(He's fast.)

1876
01:08:44.507 --> 01:08:45.674
He's too fast.

1877
01:08:45.674 --> 01:08:46.976
(Eun Hyuk is too fast, so he gives up.)

1878
01:08:47.443 --> 01:08:49.545
Hey, aren't you going to catch him?

1879
01:08:49.545 --> 01:08:53.716
(What's wrong with him? Se Chan gave up too soon.)

1880
01:08:54.016 --> 01:08:55.351
Where are they?

1881
01:08:56.252 --> 01:08:57.553
Keep going, Ji Hyo.

1882
01:09:01.490 --> 01:09:03.726
- This is all my team. - Did you find anything, So Min?

1883
01:09:03.893 --> 01:09:05.261
- Not even 10 dollars? - No.

1884
01:09:05.261 --> 01:09:06.862
We finished too fast.

1885
01:09:06.862 --> 01:09:08.030
(Why are Lee Teuk and Jae Seok...)

1886
01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:09.632
(in jail already?)

1887
01:09:10.166 --> 01:09:11.400
- Over here! - Hey, hey.

1888
01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:13.068
(1 minute into the race)

1889
01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:16.572
(They were trying to run away,)

1890
01:09:16.572 --> 01:09:18.808
(but Dong Hae got them.)

1891
01:09:18.941 --> 01:09:20.443
Hey, keep going.

1892
01:09:20.443 --> 01:09:21.710
I'm the spy. Listen to me.

1893
01:09:21.710 --> 01:09:24.113
Hold on. I'm the spy.

1894
01:09:24.113 --> 01:09:25.781
- Where? - Please save me.

1895
01:09:25.781 --> 01:09:26.982
(Lee Teuk was there too, so he got eliminated.)

1896
01:09:26.982 --> 01:09:28.350
I didn't get to do anything.

1897
01:09:29.084 --> 01:09:30.085
(They're so discouraged.)

1898
01:09:30.085 --> 01:09:31.921
I haven't done anything. This is no good.

1899
01:09:33.689 --> 01:09:35.624
(That's how they ended up here.)

1900
01:09:35.624 --> 01:09:37.526
It's hard to find even 10 dollars.

1901
01:09:37.626 --> 01:09:40.095
I think none of us here are the spy.

1902
01:09:40.362 --> 01:09:41.730
Except for you.

1903
01:09:41.730 --> 01:09:43.666
- Why me? - We were out within five minutes.

1904
01:09:43.666 --> 01:09:45.701
They got us before the five minute mark.

1905
01:09:46.402 --> 01:09:48.471
I think it's Joy...

1906
01:09:48.871 --> 01:09:49.905
Joy?

1907
01:09:49.905 --> 01:09:51.240
I think it's Eun Hyuk.

1908
01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:53.042
- Eun Hyuk? - Yes.

1909
01:09:53.042 --> 01:09:54.210
Why?

1910
01:09:54.443 --> 01:09:56.145
I just think it's him.

1911
01:09:56.679 --> 01:09:57.813
(Eun Hyuk is here.)

1912
01:09:57.813 --> 01:09:59.915
- You're not the spy? - Eun Hyuk.

1913
01:09:59.915 --> 01:10:01.083
Seok Jin.

1914
01:10:01.750 --> 01:10:05.855
I was running away, and I overheard who the spy is.

1915
01:10:07.423 --> 01:10:08.491
(Eun Hyuk knows who the spy is?)

1916
01:10:08.491 --> 01:10:09.592
What did you hear?

1917
01:10:09.792 --> 01:10:13.596
I was running away, and I saw that Joy was caught.

1918
01:10:13.996 --> 01:10:15.631
- She was making a deal with them. - What did she say?

1919
01:10:15.965 --> 01:10:18.801
She said she's the spy. So if they let her go,

1920
01:10:18.801 --> 01:10:21.003
she'll find money for them.

1921
01:10:21.370 --> 01:10:24.073
They were very receptive about it.

1922
01:10:24.073 --> 01:10:25.541
- They let her go? - Yes.

1923
01:10:25.541 --> 01:10:27.943
(Is Joy really the spy?)

1924
01:10:27.943 --> 01:10:29.512
Would it be here?

1925
01:10:31.213 --> 01:10:32.515
Is it here?

1926
01:10:33.382 --> 01:10:35.284
(Glancing around)

1927
01:10:35.284 --> 01:10:36.452
Here.

1928
01:10:37.253 --> 01:10:40.956
(She finds 1 money box.)

1929
01:10:40.956 --> 01:10:42.591
(It's 10 dollars.)

1930
01:10:42.591 --> 01:10:43.726
It's money.

1931
01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:45.294
It's 10 dollars.

1932
01:10:45.294 --> 01:10:47.096
(Joy finds 10 dollars.)

1933
01:10:48.998 --> 01:10:51.200
(She finds another box.)

1934
01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:52.701
(If she's the spy, the total will get deducted.)

1935
01:10:52.701 --> 01:10:54.069
10 dollars.

1936
01:10:54.403 --> 01:10:58.474
(Will the 20 dollars get added or deducted?)

1937
01:10:59.708 --> 01:11:00.943
(Exclaiming)

1938
01:11:01.944 --> 01:11:05.781
(Eun Hyuk finds 10 dollars as well.)

1939
01:11:05.781 --> 01:11:10.452
(Will it get added or deducted?)

1940
01:11:10.452 --> 01:11:13.255
(What are Joy and Eun Hyuk's identities?)

1941
01:11:14.123 --> 01:11:16.425
(Jingle)

1942
01:11:16.458 --> 01:11:19.662
(Ye Sung shows up...)

1943
01:11:19.662 --> 01:11:22.598
(while running out of breath.)

1944
01:11:22.598 --> 01:11:26.402
(My instincts tell me that somebody's here.)

1945
01:11:30.005 --> 01:11:33.042
(He finds a rat in the trap.)

1946
01:11:33.042 --> 01:11:35.844
(It's Kwang Soo.)

1947
01:11:35.844 --> 01:11:37.179
Se Chan!

1948
01:11:37.813 --> 01:11:39.014
Se Chan!

1949
01:11:39.014 --> 01:11:40.182
(Locking)

1950
01:11:40.916 --> 01:11:43.352
(Come out, Kwang Soo.)

1951
01:11:43.352 --> 01:11:47.423
(I'm a hunter. I don't lose preys.)

1952
01:11:47.456 --> 01:11:49.558
(I must find a way out.)

1953
01:11:49.558 --> 01:11:52.795
(He finds a window in the back.)

1954
01:11:52.795 --> 01:11:57.066
(He finds an escape route and runs away.)

1955
01:11:59.034 --> 01:12:02.471
(The hunter doesn't know that.)

1956
01:12:06.141 --> 01:12:10.145
(Kwang Soo must be too scared to come out.)

1957
01:12:12.414 --> 01:12:18.153
(He'll come out if I hide far away.)

1958
01:12:18.153 --> 01:12:20.556
(Grinning)

1959
01:12:21.256 --> 01:12:22.992
(Rattling)

1960
01:12:22.992 --> 01:12:26.295
(He keeps on checking the door.)

1961
01:12:26.295 --> 01:12:30.399
(It's about time he comes out.)

1962
01:12:30.399 --> 01:12:34.670
(Kwang Soo is so resilient.)

1963
01:12:35.070 --> 01:12:36.071
People...

1964
01:12:36.071 --> 01:12:41.043
(Is this a battle of patience?)

1965
01:12:41.043 --> 01:12:42.511
(While he's still trying to catch Kwang Soo...)

1966
01:12:42.511 --> 01:12:43.879
Here, Jong Kook!

1967
01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:47.282
(They're busy catching Eun Hyuk.)

1968
01:12:47.282 --> 01:12:48.384
Come here.

1969
01:12:50.452 --> 01:12:52.154
Wait, Jong Kook.

1970
01:12:52.154 --> 01:12:53.255
I...

1971
01:12:53.255 --> 01:12:54.289
(He's the real rat in the trap.)

1972
01:12:54.289 --> 01:12:55.591
Please gather.

1973
01:12:57.459 --> 01:12:59.595
I... Hold on.

1974
01:12:59.662 --> 01:13:00.863
This is...

1975
01:13:01.930 --> 01:13:03.632
I'm telling the truth.

1976
01:13:04.199 --> 01:13:06.435
You already noticed that I'm the spy.

1977
01:13:06.835 --> 01:13:08.904
- Eun Hyuk says he's the spy. - Hold on.

1978
01:13:08.904 --> 01:13:10.005
Wait.

1979
01:13:10.005 --> 01:13:12.041
- What did he say? - Wait.

1980
01:13:12.041 --> 01:13:13.175
- Wait. - Sit down.

1981
01:13:13.175 --> 01:13:14.910
- I will. - Get on your knees.

1982
01:13:14.910 --> 01:13:16.211
- Get on your knees. - I'll sit.

1983
01:13:16.211 --> 01:13:17.513
We eliminated most of them.

1984
01:13:17.513 --> 01:13:19.014
We did. We have Eun Hyuk left.

1985
01:13:19.248 --> 01:13:21.850
- Don't run away. - We are a team now.

1986
01:13:21.850 --> 01:13:23.819
- Eun Hyuk says he's the spy. - Let's do this.

1987
01:13:24.553 --> 01:13:27.990
(Eun Hyuk is the spy?)

1988
01:13:29.992 --> 01:13:31.360
(When is Kwang Soo coming out?)

1989
01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:32.661
It's Kwang Soo.

1990
01:13:35.664 --> 01:13:37.199
It's Kwang Soo.

1991
01:13:37.433 --> 01:13:38.567
Do we have to catch him?

1992
01:13:38.967 --> 01:13:41.270
(He sees Kwang Soo running away.)

1993
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:44.006
(How can he come from there?)

1994
01:13:44.006 --> 01:13:48.010
(The entire team hunts down Kwang Soo.)

1995
01:13:50.779 --> 01:13:51.980
Come here.

1996
01:13:52.748 --> 01:13:53.982
It's water.

1997
01:13:55.451 --> 01:13:57.753
(Splashing)

1998
01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:01.190
(He discovers his own escape route.)

1999
01:14:01.190 --> 01:14:02.291
Hey.

2000
01:14:02.291 --> 01:14:03.559
(What's wrong with him?)

2001
01:14:03.559 --> 01:14:04.660
What is he doing?

2002
01:14:04.660 --> 01:14:07.096
(That saved Eun Hyuk.)

2003
01:14:08.163 --> 01:14:11.266
(I'm going to catch Kwang Soo.)

2004
01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:12.434
If you want to get my name tag, come in.

2005
01:14:13.001 --> 01:14:14.403
Come on in.

2006
01:14:15.871 --> 01:14:17.473
(Jumping)

2007
01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:21.677
(Se Chan is persistent.)

2008
01:14:21.677 --> 01:14:23.779
- I'm sorry. - Come here.

2009
01:14:23.779 --> 01:14:25.881
- Wait, Se Chan. - I'll hold him.

2010
01:14:25.881 --> 01:14:27.750
- Wait, you. - I'm the spy.

2011
01:14:27.983 --> 01:14:29.351
Are you really the spy?

2012
01:14:29.351 --> 01:14:30.619
(It's better to let him live if he's really the spy.)

2013
01:14:30.619 --> 01:14:32.855
- Stop lying. - You're the spy?

2014
01:14:33.255 --> 01:14:36.158
Hey, we have five minutes left. Finish up.

2015
01:14:36.592 --> 01:14:38.627
Haha, get going. I'll finish up here.

2016
01:14:38.627 --> 01:14:39.795
- Should we rip off his name tag? - No.

2017
01:14:39.795 --> 01:14:42.831
I'll finish up here. Get going.

2018
01:14:44.533 --> 01:14:45.768
Why would you finish up?

2019
01:14:45.768 --> 01:14:46.835
What? I have something to say to him.

2020
01:14:46.835 --> 01:14:48.771
- Hold on. - He's acting weird, right?

2021
01:14:48.771 --> 01:14:50.005
No way.

2022
01:14:50.005 --> 01:14:52.841
- Why would he say that? - Okay.

2023
01:14:52.841 --> 01:14:54.443
- Why would you two talk? - Okay.

2024
01:14:54.443 --> 01:14:56.879
- I was wondering what that was. - We talked about something earlier.

2025
01:14:56.879 --> 01:14:58.781
- We talked about something. - Get going.

2026
01:14:58.781 --> 01:15:00.682
- We're serious. - We'll talk.

2027
01:15:01.083 --> 01:15:03.385
(They're suspicious.)

2028
01:15:03.385 --> 01:15:05.154
Is Se Chan the spy?

2029
01:15:06.255 --> 01:15:07.689
I think it's one of them.

2030
01:15:07.689 --> 01:15:09.391
If you move, I'll rip off your name tag.

2031
01:15:09.992 --> 01:15:11.293
We need to talk.

2032
01:15:11.293 --> 01:15:12.694
Don't worry. I'll finish up.

2033
01:15:12.694 --> 01:15:14.897
(What is Se Chan's identity?)

2034
01:15:15.264 --> 01:15:16.765
Se Chan is the spy for the other team.

2035
01:15:16.765 --> 01:15:19.268
(Se Chan is the spy then.)

2036
01:15:19.635 --> 01:15:20.769
We can eliminate Kwang Soo.

2037
01:15:20.769 --> 01:15:22.871
(Why is Se Chan not ripping off Kwang Soo's name tag?)

2038
01:15:22.871 --> 01:15:23.972
Did you find something?

2039
01:15:23.972 --> 01:15:26.275
I found nothing. We didn't find anything.

2040
01:15:26.441 --> 01:15:27.910
Continuing this game is useless.

2041
01:15:28.243 --> 01:15:29.378
We can rip his off, Dong Hae.

2042
01:15:29.378 --> 01:15:30.913
Wait. Why am I getting confused?

2043
01:15:30.913 --> 01:15:32.080
No, we're right.

2044
01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:35.851
(If he's the spy, he'll try to help the other team.)

2045
01:15:37.419 --> 01:15:38.654
(Slipping)

2046
01:15:38.654 --> 01:15:39.822
I found it.

2047
01:15:40.055 --> 01:15:42.591
(He found a box?)

2048
01:15:42.591 --> 01:15:44.660
I got 10 dollars. Okay!

2049
01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:47.262
(Did Se Chan just help Kwang Soo?)

2050
01:15:47.262 --> 01:15:48.497
Let's rip his name tag off.

2051
01:15:48.497 --> 01:15:49.598
(What's going on?)

2052
01:15:49.598 --> 01:15:50.699
Hold on.

2053
01:15:51.266 --> 01:15:54.203
(He's close to ripping it off.)

2054
01:15:55.137 --> 01:15:56.205
(What are they doing?)

2055
01:15:56.205 --> 01:15:57.573
What's going on?

2056
01:15:57.840 --> 01:15:59.308
He got my name tag.

2057
01:15:59.308 --> 01:16:00.742
- Ye Sung. - Jong Kook.

2058
01:16:00.742 --> 01:16:01.910
Ye Sung and Dong Hae!

2059
01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:03.612
- Wait. - Stand up.

2060
01:16:03.612 --> 01:16:05.480
- He's the spy. - Jong Kook!

2061
01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:06.615
- Is he? - Rip it.

2062
01:16:06.615 --> 01:16:08.016
Find the rest.

2063
01:16:08.016 --> 01:16:09.218
Rip his name tag off.

2064
01:16:09.218 --> 01:16:11.920
Look. I'm sure he's the spy.

2065
01:16:13.255 --> 01:16:14.857
I checked if he was the spy.

2066
01:16:14.890 --> 01:16:16.058
He hid a box here.

2067
01:16:16.058 --> 01:16:19.094
I checked to confirm whether he's the spy or not.

2068
01:16:19.561 --> 01:16:20.963
- Are you sure? - He got tricked.

2069
01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:25.701
(Is Se Chan telling the truth? Or is he the spy?)

2070
01:16:25.701 --> 01:16:27.803
I think it might be Se Chan.

2071
01:16:29.137 --> 01:16:31.673
(There are a few suspects left.)

2072
01:16:33.375 --> 01:16:35.310
I'm going to work hard...

2073
01:16:35.310 --> 01:16:37.012
and eliminate two people.

2074
01:16:37.379 --> 01:16:40.382
I'm a cop rather than a thief. I like catching people.

2075
01:16:40.649 --> 01:16:42.017
- Okay. Let's go. - Okay.

2076
01:16:42.951 --> 01:16:44.653
Jong Kook, let's have one each.

2077
01:16:44.653 --> 01:16:45.921
We need energy.

2078
01:16:45.921 --> 01:16:47.823
We worked hard, so we need some vitamin.

2079
01:16:47.823 --> 01:16:49.391
Dong Hae.

2080
01:16:49.491 --> 01:16:50.959
Don't give it to the spy.

2081
01:16:51.193 --> 01:16:53.161
It's not me, Haha. Stop picking on me.

2082
01:16:53.161 --> 01:16:55.364
- Okay. Let's drink this first. - Please.

2083
01:16:55.364 --> 01:16:57.232
- Should we toast? - Let's do that.

2084
01:16:57.232 --> 01:16:58.834
We are going into defense mode now.

2085
01:16:58.834 --> 01:17:00.302
Let's drink this...

2086
01:17:00.302 --> 01:17:01.803
- and defend well. - Let's work hard.

2087
01:17:01.803 --> 01:17:03.205
- Let's do this. - Good luck, spy.

2088
01:17:03.205 --> 01:17:05.641
Spy, good luck.

2089
01:17:05.641 --> 01:17:08.410
I can feel the vitamin flowing throughout my body.

2090
01:17:08.710 --> 01:17:11.313
The countdown will begin.

2091
01:17:11.313 --> 01:17:12.514
I'll catch all of them.

2092
01:17:12.881 --> 01:17:14.316
Let's survive first.

2093
01:17:14.449 --> 01:17:15.651
Five,

2094
01:17:15.884 --> 01:17:17.386
- four, - Let's go.

2095
01:17:17.386 --> 01:17:18.620
three,

2096
01:17:18.620 --> 01:17:19.955
two,

2097
01:17:19.955 --> 01:17:21.089
one.

2098
01:17:21.089 --> 01:17:23.659
Race starts.

2099
01:17:24.159 --> 01:17:25.961
Let's end this.

2100
01:17:27.229 --> 01:17:30.265
(Team Big Nose starts their attack.)

2101
01:17:30.265 --> 01:17:31.566
They're there underneath.

2102
01:17:31.633 --> 01:17:32.701
That's jackpot.

2103
01:17:32.701 --> 01:17:33.869
(They're all there.)

2104
01:17:35.470 --> 01:17:38.473
Are there boxes here? They might be here.

2105
01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:39.875
They must be,

2106
01:17:39.875 --> 01:17:41.710
but I looked earlier and there were none.

2107
01:17:42.544 --> 01:17:45.080
(Where are the boxes?)

2108
01:17:49.885 --> 01:17:51.119
There's nobody here, right?

2109
01:17:51.954 --> 01:17:54.556
(She looks left and right and fetches the money.)

2110
01:17:54.556 --> 01:17:55.691
I got it.

2111
01:17:55.691 --> 01:17:57.025
(She's meticulous.)

2112
01:17:57.659 --> 01:17:59.061
I got it.

2113
01:17:59.461 --> 01:18:01.396
- They're here. - Where?

2114
01:18:01.730 --> 01:18:04.633
Here. Jong Kook.

2115
01:18:04.666 --> 01:18:05.701
Oh, gosh.

2116
01:18:05.701 --> 01:18:08.971
(They run away.)

2117
01:18:10.706 --> 01:18:12.307
Here. Jong Kook.

2118
01:18:12.307 --> 01:18:13.375
(They're after Jong Kook.)

2119
01:18:13.375 --> 01:18:14.609
Darn it.

2120
01:18:16.912 --> 01:18:19.681
(They corner Jong Kook.)

2121
01:18:23.251 --> 01:18:25.053
- Where did he go? - He's climbing.

2122
01:18:25.654 --> 01:18:26.922
Catch him.

2123
01:18:28.123 --> 01:18:30.492
(Climbing)

2124
01:18:31.626 --> 01:18:32.794
(He's ascending the rope.)

2125
01:18:32.794 --> 01:18:34.963
Catch him.

2126
01:18:35.163 --> 01:18:36.365
Jong Kook.

2127
01:18:36.365 --> 01:18:37.933
Come down.

2128
01:18:37.933 --> 01:18:39.468
You'll come down at one point.

2129
01:18:39.468 --> 01:18:41.336
- You'll come down at one point. - Come down.

2130
01:18:41.336 --> 01:18:42.871
- Jong Kook. - Come down.

2131
01:18:43.505 --> 01:18:45.674
How did he do that? Jong Kook.

2132
01:18:46.875 --> 01:18:51.113
(Irene escaped thanks to Jong Kook.)

2133
01:18:51.113 --> 01:18:52.881
(She's startled.)

2134
01:18:54.449 --> 01:18:57.552
(Lee Teuk sees her.)

2135
01:18:57.919 --> 01:18:59.521
Hold on. Lee Teuk.

2136
01:19:00.122 --> 01:19:02.290
Wait. I am the spy.

2137
01:19:02.290 --> 01:19:04.192
- Get her. - Wait. I'm the spy.

2138
01:19:04.192 --> 01:19:06.094
I'm serious.

2139
01:19:06.661 --> 01:19:08.530
In 1, 2, 3.

2140
01:19:08.630 --> 01:19:09.731
Lee Teuk.

2141
01:19:09.731 --> 01:19:10.999
(Ripping)

2142
01:19:12.167 --> 01:19:14.369
We caught one. Let's go.

2143
01:19:14.403 --> 01:19:15.937
Who's that?

2144
01:19:17.572 --> 01:19:21.476
(Ji Hyo was looking for a chance. She makes her move.)

2145
01:19:23.211 --> 01:19:27.549
(But Eun Hyuk is right in front of her.)

2146
01:19:28.083 --> 01:19:29.551
What are you?

2147
01:19:29.551 --> 01:19:33.922
(She bumps into the fastest person here.)

2148
01:19:33.922 --> 01:19:35.123
What are you? What's this?

2149
01:19:35.123 --> 01:19:36.992
Find it. Take that.

2150
01:19:36.992 --> 01:19:39.594
(Find it. Take that.)

2151
01:19:43.832 --> 01:19:45.634
Really? Eun Hyuk.

2152
01:19:45.634 --> 01:19:47.402
(Eun Hyuk tells her where the box is.)

2153
01:19:47.402 --> 01:19:49.571
(What is his identity?)

2154
01:19:49.571 --> 01:19:50.839
(Spy)

2155
01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:53.708
(He's the spy of Team Big Nose.)

2156
01:19:53.708 --> 01:19:55.343
There's so much pressure.

2157
01:19:56.044 --> 01:19:57.479
You saw earlier.

2158
01:19:57.479 --> 01:20:00.582
(He started doing his job right away.)

2159
01:20:00.582 --> 01:20:04.753
(He gave away answers during Guess the Amount mission.)

2160
01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:07.122
He's too fast.

2161
01:20:07.122 --> 01:20:11.593
(And during dibidibidip, he helped the other team discretely.)

2162
01:20:11.593 --> 01:20:12.994
You shouldn't be slower than me.

2163
01:20:12.994 --> 01:20:17.132
(He looks innocent, but he has 12 years of experience on TV.)

2164
01:20:17.199 --> 01:20:18.700
I think I'm a good spy.

2165
01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:20.502
(He's proud of himself.)

2166
01:20:21.803 --> 01:20:24.072
You should catch the other guys.

2167
01:20:24.072 --> 01:20:26.274
Catch them.

2168
01:20:29.678 --> 01:20:30.846
(Throwing)

2169
01:20:32.013 --> 01:20:34.449
(He throws the bell.)

2170
01:20:36.585 --> 01:20:39.221
(It doesn't look like Jong Kook is planning on coming down.)

2171
01:20:39.221 --> 01:20:41.423
Hey, get up there.

2172
01:20:41.556 --> 01:20:43.225
- Why can't you go up there? - We have to climb up...

2173
01:20:43.625 --> 01:20:45.594
and rip his name tag off.

2174
01:20:46.261 --> 01:20:47.562
He'll just keep going up.

2175
01:20:48.296 --> 01:20:50.899
- Shake it. - Keep an eye on him.

2176
01:20:50.899 --> 01:20:52.033
All right?

2177
01:20:52.033 --> 01:20:54.002
- Don't let him do anything. - Okay.

2178
01:20:54.002 --> 01:20:55.737
- Make sure he doesn't come down. - That's right.

2179
01:20:57.205 --> 01:21:00.275
Let's see how long you can stay there.

2180
01:21:01.543 --> 01:21:04.813
(Collapsing)

2181
01:21:08.450 --> 01:21:09.885
How did you get up there?

2182
01:21:10.418 --> 01:21:11.920
(Sliding)

2183
01:21:13.522 --> 01:21:15.991
(He descends since Seok Jin is alone.)

2184
01:21:16.791 --> 01:21:18.793
I came down since it's just you. I wanted to rest.

2185
01:21:18.793 --> 01:21:20.095
Hey!

2186
01:21:22.531 --> 01:21:23.832
Come here.

2187
01:21:24.533 --> 01:21:25.834
- He's calling you. - Did he come down?

2188
01:21:25.834 --> 01:21:27.202
Go. Hurry.

2189
01:21:28.403 --> 01:21:29.704
Hey.

2190
01:21:29.704 --> 01:21:31.072
(Who's attacking and who's defending here?)

2191
01:21:31.072 --> 01:21:33.308
Go. Go somewhere else.

2192
01:21:33.909 --> 01:21:35.043
Gosh.

2193
01:21:36.211 --> 01:21:39.281
(As soon as Kwang Soo comes, he runs away.)

2194
01:21:39.281 --> 01:21:41.049
Catch him.

2195
01:21:43.752 --> 01:21:47.155
(It's a race between the tiger and the giraffe.)

2196
01:21:48.023 --> 01:21:49.124
That hurt my pride.

2197
01:21:49.124 --> 01:21:52.160
(He's in wreck.)

2198
01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:53.461
That hurt my pride.

2199
01:21:53.795 --> 01:21:55.230
There he is.

2200
01:21:55.263 --> 01:21:59.267
(Haha finds some get-together money.)

2201
01:22:03.004 --> 01:22:04.172
Irene.

2202
01:22:04.639 --> 01:22:05.740
You didn't get caught, right?

2203
01:22:05.740 --> 01:22:07.275
- I got caught. - Sorry?

2204
01:22:07.309 --> 01:22:08.443
I got caught.

2205
01:22:08.443 --> 01:22:09.544
Why are you so bad?

2206
01:22:09.544 --> 01:22:11.179
(He tries to give away the fact that he's the spy.)

2207
01:22:11.179 --> 01:22:13.815
I wanted to help you.

2208
01:22:14.182 --> 01:22:16.585
Eun Hyuk is here!

2209
01:22:16.585 --> 01:22:18.153
(Seeing Jong Kook doesn't faze him.)

2210
01:22:18.153 --> 01:22:19.588
We are on the same side, Irene.

2211
01:22:19.588 --> 01:22:20.889
- Really? - Of course.

2212
01:22:20.889 --> 01:22:23.525
Jong Kook, I am not lying when I say this.

2213
01:22:23.625 --> 01:22:25.660
I found a box and gave it to Ji Hyo.

2214
01:22:27.162 --> 01:22:29.197
I am not lying. You have to trust me.

2215
01:22:32.167 --> 01:22:34.002
Please wait.

2216
01:22:34.002 --> 01:22:35.971
(He ties and unties the laces for minutes.)

2217
01:22:38.306 --> 01:22:39.341
Okay.

2218
01:22:39.341 --> 01:22:41.943
(Se Chan is suspected of being the spy.)

2219
01:22:41.943 --> 01:22:43.812
Okay. 10 dollars.

2220
01:22:47.782 --> 01:22:48.950
Se Chan, how much did you find?

2221
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:50.051
10 dollars.

2222
01:22:50.151 --> 01:22:54.089
(If Se Chan is the spy, they lose 10 dollars.)

2223
01:22:54.689 --> 01:22:56.691
- Are you the spy? - No.

2224
01:22:56.691 --> 01:22:59.261
Look, I am not the spy.

2225
01:22:59.361 --> 01:23:01.463
What are you doing?

2226
01:23:01.463 --> 01:23:03.932
(Give me the box, you spy.)

2227
01:23:03.932 --> 01:23:06.101
- Ji Hyo. - Give it to me.

2228
01:23:06.101 --> 01:23:08.103
Ji Hyo, we are on the same team.

2229
01:23:08.103 --> 01:23:09.304
- Why are you attacking me? - You are the spy.

2230
01:23:09.304 --> 01:23:10.672
- I am not the spy. - You are.

2231
01:23:10.672 --> 01:23:12.240
- Are you the spy? - You are the spy, right?

2232
01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:13.708
- Are you the spy? - I am not the spy.

2233
01:23:13.708 --> 01:23:15.010
- I am not the spy. - I am not the spy.

2234
01:23:15.010 --> 01:23:16.011
Why did you...

2235
01:23:16.011 --> 01:23:17.112
(They are suspicious of each other.)

2236
01:23:19.247 --> 01:23:20.248
What is going on?

2237
01:23:20.248 --> 01:23:21.349
(Teuk appears.)

2238
01:23:22.250 --> 01:23:24.386
(When Teuk attacks Se Chan,)

2239
01:23:24.386 --> 01:23:26.821
(Ji Hyo runs for her life.)

2240
01:23:29.491 --> 01:23:30.692
(Kwang Soo, get Se Chan.)

2241
01:23:30.692 --> 01:23:32.861
Kwang Soo, corner Se Chan.

2242
01:23:33.628 --> 01:23:35.163
(Se Chan and Kwang Soo go into the 2nd round in water.)

2243
01:23:35.163 --> 01:23:36.264
Kwang Soo!

2244
01:23:36.331 --> 01:23:38.500
Kwang Soo! Kwang Soo!

2245
01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:39.734
My goodness.

2246
01:23:40.268 --> 01:23:41.269
Get him.

2247
01:23:41.269 --> 01:23:42.971
(Eun Hyuk, the spy, joins the chase.)

2248
01:23:44.973 --> 01:23:48.043
I can't be eliminated. I can't be eliminated.

2249
01:23:48.043 --> 01:23:49.044
(Ripping)

2250
01:23:49.044 --> 01:23:50.045
Kwang Soo!

2251
01:23:50.045 --> 01:23:51.346
(Se Chan is out.)

2252
01:23:51.346 --> 01:23:52.614
I went into the water again because of you.

2253
01:23:53.181 --> 01:23:55.050
- I got him. - Who?

2254
01:23:55.083 --> 01:23:57.352
- I got Se Chan. - Se Chan?

2255
01:24:01.289 --> 01:24:04.292
I did a good job of pretending to get him. Perfect.

2256
01:24:04.392 --> 01:24:06.094
- Be quiet, Joy. - For goodness' sake.

2257
01:24:06.094 --> 01:24:08.363
Otherwise, I will say that you are the spy.

2258
01:24:08.363 --> 01:24:09.331
(He will say that Joy is the spy.)

2259
01:24:09.331 --> 01:24:10.432
For goodness' sake.

2260
01:24:10.999 --> 01:24:13.501
Ye Sung. Ye Sung.

2261
01:24:14.002 --> 01:24:15.804
Rip it off.

2262
01:24:16.504 --> 01:24:17.505
That way.

2263
01:24:17.505 --> 01:24:18.673
(He plays an active role in ripping off the other's name tag.)

2264
01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:21.176
You saw me get him, right?

2265
01:24:21.176 --> 01:24:22.344
(Proud)

2266
01:24:23.011 --> 01:24:25.313
I have to do this to avoid suspicion.

2267
01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:27.015
Who is out?

2268
01:24:27.015 --> 01:24:30.752
(Eun Hyuk, Irene, Ye Sung, and Se Chan are out.)

2269
01:24:30.885 --> 01:24:33.555
Who did we get? Who are still in the game?

2270
01:24:33.555 --> 01:24:35.323
- We got most of them. - Jong Kook, Haha...

2271
01:24:35.323 --> 01:24:36.891
- Ji Hyo. - What?

2272
01:24:36.891 --> 01:24:38.860
- Ji Hyo. - She is out.

2273
01:24:38.860 --> 01:24:40.462
That means Jong Kook and Haha remain.

2274
01:24:42.664 --> 01:24:43.898
There he is.

2275
01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:46.534
(Teuk finds Jong Kook.)

2276
01:24:46.534 --> 01:24:48.770
- Where? - There he is.

2277
01:24:49.204 --> 01:24:50.205
There he is.

2278
01:24:50.205 --> 01:24:53.608
(The tiger hunt begins.)

2279
01:24:54.909 --> 01:24:58.513
(3 minutes remain until the end of the 2nd round.)

2280
01:25:03.385 --> 01:25:05.153
(Teuk succeeds in cornering the tiger.)

2281
01:25:05.153 --> 01:25:07.322
I could feel that someone was watching me.

2282
01:25:07.822 --> 01:25:10.658
(There are only two of us.)

2283
01:25:10.658 --> 01:25:11.793
(Jong Kook defends himself as if he is attacking.)

2284
01:25:11.793 --> 01:25:12.861
Over here!

2285
01:25:12.861 --> 01:25:14.596
(Jong Kook defends himself as if he is attacking.)

2286
01:25:14.863 --> 01:25:16.431
My goodness.

2287
01:25:16.765 --> 01:25:18.266
Over here!

2288
01:25:19.401 --> 01:25:20.402
My goodness.

2289
01:25:20.402 --> 01:25:21.970
Come on out, Jong Kook.

2290
01:25:22.771 --> 01:25:23.772
Let's fight.

2291
01:25:23.772 --> 01:25:25.073
(Let's fight.)

2292
01:25:25.073 --> 01:25:27.976
(What is she talking about?)

2293
01:25:28.376 --> 01:25:31.279
- What are you talking about? - I should run away.

2294
01:25:31.279 --> 01:25:32.647
I have you by my side.

2295
01:25:32.781 --> 01:25:34.749
People call us the three idiots these days.

2296
01:25:34.749 --> 01:25:38.620
(People call us the three idiots these days.)

2297
01:25:39.053 --> 01:25:40.455
I am not an idiot.

2298
01:25:40.455 --> 01:25:42.690
- I am not an idiot. - You are the biggest idiot.

2299
01:25:45.059 --> 01:25:47.629
(Meanwhile, Haha, the other survivor,)

2300
01:25:47.629 --> 01:25:49.864
(finds another box that contains get-together money.)

2301
01:25:51.599 --> 01:25:54.502
(This is his 2nd box.)

2302
01:25:57.972 --> 01:26:00.775
We need to put an end to this.

2303
01:26:01.543 --> 01:26:03.111
Over here!

2304
01:26:03.711 --> 01:26:04.813
My goodness.

2305
01:26:04.913 --> 01:26:06.381
Over here!

2306
01:26:06.381 --> 01:26:08.983
(I recognize this voice.)

2307
01:26:10.885 --> 01:26:14.389
(Joy and Kwang Soo follow Teuk's voice.)

2308
01:26:14.389 --> 01:26:15.690
Here!

2309
01:26:16.991 --> 01:26:18.493
- Hurry up. - What is going on?

2310
01:26:18.493 --> 01:26:20.462
My goodness.

2311
01:26:20.462 --> 01:26:22.530
Since when were you in this position?

2312
01:26:22.530 --> 01:26:23.631
(Ripping)

2313
01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:26.301
Joy ripped it off.

2314
01:26:26.301 --> 01:26:28.803
(Jong Kook is out.)

2315
01:26:29.671 --> 01:26:32.373
You were gone for a pretty long time.

2316
01:26:32.373 --> 01:26:34.509
(Teuk is the top contributor in catching Jong Kook.)

2317
01:26:34.509 --> 01:26:36.811
- My goodness. - Race With Bells ends.

2318
01:26:36.811 --> 01:26:40.381
(Race With Bells ends.)

2319
01:26:40.381 --> 01:26:44.352
(Both teams have similar amount of get-together money.)

2320
01:26:44.652 --> 01:26:48.756
Now, it's time to find the spies.

2321
01:26:48.756 --> 01:26:50.992
(Arresting the spy gives the team 50 dollars.)

2322
01:26:51.493 --> 01:26:54.963
Team Big Nose will go first.

2323
01:26:55.163 --> 01:26:57.932
- To be honest, I am not sure. - I have no idea.

2324
01:26:58.166 --> 01:26:59.701
- We will go by the majority rule. - Let's do that.

2325
01:26:59.701 --> 01:27:02.103
(They decide to go by the majority rule.)

2326
01:27:02.103 --> 01:27:04.072
(Nervous)

2327
01:27:06.174 --> 01:27:07.275
Eun Hyuk.

2328
01:27:07.342 --> 01:27:09.244
I could hear that!

2329
01:27:09.244 --> 01:27:10.378
(Flustered)

2330
01:27:10.378 --> 01:27:11.379
- I could hear that! - Eun Hyuk.

2331
01:27:11.379 --> 01:27:13.348
(I don't need to hide the answer when Eun Hyuk is the spy.)

2332
01:27:13.348 --> 01:27:16.351
I think it's either Joy or Eun Hyuk.

2333
01:27:16.351 --> 01:27:17.352
(The 2 of them are the suspects.)

2334
01:27:17.352 --> 01:27:18.453
Me too.

2335
01:27:19.087 --> 01:27:21.222
Except for Eun Hyuk, everyone voted for Eun Hyuk.

2336
01:27:22.690 --> 01:27:24.092
Joy...

2337
01:27:24.492 --> 01:27:27.161
It doesn't make sense that Joy found 20 dollars.

2338
01:27:27.161 --> 01:27:28.963
(He throws them off.)

2339
01:27:29.364 --> 01:27:31.599
- I don't know anymore. - I think it's Joy.

2340
01:27:31.599 --> 01:27:33.468
I think it's Joy.

2341
01:27:33.468 --> 01:27:34.903
- We worked together. - Did you see that?

2342
01:27:34.903 --> 01:27:36.204
Did you see her facial expression?

2343
01:27:36.204 --> 01:27:37.772
- I think it's Joy. - Did you see her facial expression?

2344
01:27:37.772 --> 01:27:39.240
- It's not me. - It's her.

2345
01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:40.742
- Let's vote again. - I vote for Joy too.

2346
01:27:40.742 --> 01:27:42.944
Where did you find the 20 dollars?

2347
01:27:42.944 --> 01:27:46.381
I found 10 dollars inside the pot over there.

2348
01:27:46.414 --> 01:27:47.882
Then I found another 10 dollars inside the pot over there.

2349
01:27:47.882 --> 01:27:49.751
- Of course you did. - Let's go with Joy.

2350
01:27:49.751 --> 01:27:51.386
- No! - In 1, 2, 3.

2351
01:27:51.386 --> 01:27:52.387
- Joy! - Joy!

2352
01:27:52.387 --> 01:27:53.488
(We think Joy is the spy.)

2353
01:27:54.088 --> 01:27:55.890
It makes no sense that she found two boxes in the pots.

2354
01:27:55.890 --> 01:27:57.358
(Eun Hyuk leads them to vote for innocent Joy.)

2355
01:27:57.892 --> 01:27:59.294
What is Team Hare and Tortoise's decision?

2356
01:27:59.994 --> 01:28:01.095
In one...

2357
01:28:01.162 --> 01:28:02.630
(Who is the spy in Team Hare and Tortoise?)

2358
01:28:02.630 --> 01:28:03.631
Two.

2359
01:28:03.631 --> 01:28:04.732
(Who is the spy in Team Hare and Tortoise?)

2360
01:28:05.333 --> 01:28:08.369
(Is it Se Chan,)

2361
01:28:08.369 --> 01:28:11.573
(who chased after Eun Hyuk but gave up so easily?)

2362
01:28:12.173 --> 01:28:13.308
Eun Hyuk is fast!

2363
01:28:14.442 --> 01:28:18.713
(He behaved in a suspicious way when he caught Kwang Soo.)

2364
01:28:20.081 --> 01:28:21.783
2, 3.

2365
01:28:21.783 --> 01:28:22.850
- Se Chan. - Se Chan.

2366
01:28:22.951 --> 01:28:25.053
It's not me.

2367
01:28:25.453 --> 01:28:29.457
(The teams' choices are Se Chan and Joy.)

2368
01:28:29.457 --> 01:28:32.360
Team Big Nose's spy...

2369
01:28:32.794 --> 01:28:34.195
is...

2370
01:28:34.862 --> 01:28:36.464
not Joy but Eun Hyuk.

2371
01:28:36.464 --> 01:28:37.699
For goodness' sake.

2372
01:28:38.333 --> 01:28:41.269
Our first guess was right.

2373
01:28:41.269 --> 01:28:42.570
(Why did you get fooled at the last moment?)

2374
01:28:42.570 --> 01:28:44.372
I am sorry, Joy.

2375
01:28:44.372 --> 01:28:47.742
Who said we should vote for Joy?

2376
01:28:47.742 --> 01:28:49.377
You did a good job.

2377
01:28:49.377 --> 01:28:50.979
- I helped you find the money. - Thank you.

2378
01:28:50.979 --> 01:28:53.014
He showed me where the box is.

2379
01:28:53.014 --> 01:28:56.250
- He showed me where the box is. - I really like this team.

2380
01:28:56.751 --> 01:28:58.820
I wanted to join this team.

2381
01:28:58.820 --> 01:29:01.823
I will reveal the spy of Team Hare and Tortoise.

2382
01:29:01.823 --> 01:29:02.890
(Who is the spy in Team Hare and Tortoise?)

2383
01:29:04.892 --> 01:29:08.162
(Everyone voted for Se Chan.)

2384
01:29:08.162 --> 01:29:09.464
(If Se Chan is the spy, the team wins 50 dollars.)

2385
01:29:09.464 --> 01:29:12.000
Team Hare and Tortoise's spy...

2386
01:29:12.100 --> 01:29:13.968
It has to be him.

2387
01:29:14.302 --> 01:29:18.573
(Who is the spy in Team Hare and Tortoise?)

2388
01:29:18.573 --> 01:29:20.174
is...

2389
01:29:20.174 --> 01:29:23.845
(Is it Se Chan?)

2390
01:29:23.845 --> 01:29:25.079
not Se Chan...

2391
01:29:26.547 --> 01:29:27.649
but Haha.

2392
01:29:28.583 --> 01:29:30.518
(Haha is the spy.)

2393
01:29:30.518 --> 01:29:31.819
(Annoyed)

2394
01:29:31.819 --> 01:29:33.588
Why did you vote for me?

2395
01:29:33.588 --> 01:29:36.224
(I got you fooled, right?)

2396
01:29:37.558 --> 01:29:39.360
(Checking his identity)

2397
01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:41.863
(I am the spy.)

2398
01:29:44.599 --> 01:29:47.468
(He signaled Team Big Nose.)

2399
01:29:48.202 --> 01:29:52.540
(He worked hard to give the penalty to Team Hare and Tortoise.)

2400
01:29:53.241 --> 01:29:55.843
(During the race)

2401
01:29:57.011 --> 01:29:58.980
(Take this.)

2402
01:29:59.781 --> 01:30:03.051
(He gave the get-together money to Team Big Nose.)

2403
01:30:05.553 --> 01:30:09.190
(When he found Joy in hiding...)

2404
01:30:09.190 --> 01:30:10.291
(I am the spy.)

2405
01:30:10.291 --> 01:30:11.392
(Really?)

2406
01:30:11.859 --> 01:30:13.594
(Tell people that I am the spy.)

2407
01:30:14.562 --> 01:30:16.364
(Having played the spy race for 8 years...)

2408
01:30:16.364 --> 01:30:18.366
(made him the perfect spy.)

2409
01:30:19.267 --> 01:30:20.902
Haha.

2410
01:30:20.902 --> 01:30:24.505
- Haha. - Thank you for your hard work.

2411
01:30:24.505 --> 01:30:26.240
- Seriously. - You did a good job.

2412
01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:27.942
- Seriously. - Seriously.

2413
01:30:28.009 --> 01:30:30.511
It must have been hard to be in that team.

2414
01:30:30.511 --> 01:30:31.713
Let's get the total.

2415
01:30:31.713 --> 01:30:34.048
Team Big Nose started with 60 dollars...

2416
01:30:34.382 --> 01:30:35.550
and found 40 dollars.

2417
01:30:35.550 --> 01:30:38.252
Since Eun Hyuk found 10 dollars, the team has 90 dollars.

2418
01:30:38.252 --> 01:30:39.353
90 dollars.

2419
01:30:40.088 --> 01:30:43.891
Team Hare and Tortoise started with 60 dollars and found 60 dollars.

2420
01:30:43.891 --> 01:30:47.195
Since Haha found 20 dollars, the team has 100 dollars.

2421
01:30:47.662 --> 01:30:52.100
Team Hare and Tortoise wins.

2422
01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.236
We won!

2423
01:30:55.403 --> 01:30:59.741
Haha became the bad person for nothing.

2424
01:30:59.741 --> 01:31:02.910
Haha, good job.

2425
01:31:02.910 --> 01:31:06.714
Team Hare and Tortoise gets the chicken party...

2426
01:31:06.714 --> 01:31:08.583
- with 100 dollars. - Okay.

2427
01:31:08.583 --> 01:31:09.851
(Team Hare and Tortoise gets the chicken party.)

2428
01:31:10.918 --> 01:31:12.587
(Spicy and sweet)

2429
01:31:12.587 --> 01:31:14.489
Please enjoy.

2430
01:31:14.789 --> 01:31:17.258
You contributed the most.

2431
01:31:17.258 --> 01:31:18.392
- Eat up, Eun Hyuk. - Okay.

2432
01:31:18.392 --> 01:31:20.862
We almost didn't get to eat this.
