(Episode 10)

2
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.380
You also heard it, didn't you?

3
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.549
She's just using you.

4
00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:41.629
You haven't experienced enough.

5
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.769
That's how the world is like.

6
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.400
People don't approach people like us...

7
00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:50.409
without an ulterior motive.

8
00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:56.150
You shouldn't have trusted people just because they were nice to you.

9
00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:00.879
What do you mean by people like us?

10
00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.760
People with a lot of fortunes and privileges.

11
00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.919
People who can do almost everything they wish.

12
00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:09.729
Our family...

13
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.660
started as a merchant.

14
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.669
Father.

15
00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:18.639
This is the limit of the people you've sacrificed...

16
00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:20.070
your whole life.

17
00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:34.490
Check for yourself.

18
00:01:45.699 --> 00:01:47.660
(Disciplinary Result)

19
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.400
(We have decided to dismiss Baek Seung Gi for bribery.)

20
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.770
(Committee members' signature)

21
00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:01.309
They have no courtesy for people...

22
00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:04.579
and they are snobs.

23
00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:07.120
(Gangsu Group Related Data)

24
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.120

(National Tax Service Lobby List)

31
00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:29.539
(Workbook 1)

32
00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:34.140
Father, you can't even imagine...

33
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.480
what I've done...

34
00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:38.020
to stay loyal to these people.

35
00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:10.009
Don't ignore what Mr. Byun said...

36
00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:12.279
about June's father.

37
00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:15.120
Why are you also saying that?

38
00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:17.860
I don't care what Woo Sung says.

39
00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:20.020
It's relevant if he thinks it's a problem.

40
00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:24.390
He thinks that June has a grudge against the company.

41
00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:27.430
That's why he's uncomfortable seeing June next to you.

42
00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:29.330
The fact that I like June has nothing to do with him.

43
00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:32.640
You have no idea how scary your brother is.

44
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.240
He does everything it takes to realize his goals.

45
00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:40.839
What do you mean?

46
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.819
Your brother released...

47
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:53.390
your air rage video.

48
00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.289
This is a warning.

49
00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:00.230
He won't let you act up again.

50
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:09.870
So, Woo Sung...

51
00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:14.110
wants to get rid of me.

52
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.350
Right, Je Hoon?

53
00:04:24.519 --> 00:04:27.259
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

54
00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:33.030
Do you think it was easy for me to tell you this?

55
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.730
It must have been difficult...

56
00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:39.970
for you to keep this to yourself.

57
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:37.329
It was a nice meal.

58
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:39.860
It was.

59
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:45.970
June.

60
00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:47.699
I'm tired.

61
00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:51.639
I'll go inside first.

62
00:05:54.649 --> 00:05:55.649
All right. Go rest.

63
00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:45.829
(My daughter)

64
00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:49.430
Hello?

65
00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.800
June, what's going on? You never call me first.

66
00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:57.110
Hello? June?

67
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:02.610
Yes, Mom.

68
00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.319
How are you?

69
00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.120
I'm always doing fine.

70
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.220
Is everything all right with you?

71
00:07:13.059 --> 00:07:14.319
It's fine.

72
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:19.399
I'll visit you in a few days. I made lettuce kimchi that you like.

73
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.629
Gosh, Mom.

74
00:07:22.829 --> 00:07:25.040
It was Dad who liked lettuce kimchi.

75
00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:28.269
Really?

76
00:07:31.379 --> 00:07:32.379
Mom.

77
00:07:36.209 --> 00:07:37.949
What was Dad like?

78
00:07:38.879 --> 00:07:41.149
Why? Is something wrong?

79
00:07:43.319 --> 00:07:44.319
No, just asking.

80
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.819
Why? What's wrong, June?

81
00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:57.939
Did Dad...

82
00:08:01.769 --> 00:08:02.769
really get fired...

83
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:04.939
from Gangsu Group...

84
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.879
because he was bribed?

85
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.579
What are you talking about?

86
00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.680
Who told you that? Where did you hear that?

87
00:08:16.319 --> 00:08:17.350
Gosh.

88
00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:22.360
I'm so upset, Mom.

89
00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:40.740
Poor girl.

90
00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:44.049
According to Mr. Kwon,

91
00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:46.580
the rooftop is an awful place to live in.

92
00:08:48.889 --> 00:08:50.590
She cleans to make her living.

93
00:08:50.919 --> 00:08:52.460
Of course she lives in an awful place.

94
00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:56.830
But still, she's the person who has brought Hyuk to his senses.

95
00:08:57.259 --> 00:09:00.399
Are you just going to leave her to be a cleaner?

96
00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:02.600
What are you saying?

97
00:09:03.129 --> 00:09:06.899
She should be brought to a certain level so that people won't gossip.

98
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:11.310
She stormed into my room to say everything she wanted to say.

99
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:13.179
I guess she's no ordinary person.

100
00:09:14.549 --> 00:09:16.909
And she helped Hyuk act like a human being.

101
00:09:17.879 --> 00:09:19.679
She must have a lot to offer too.

102
00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:21.990
Yes, Father.

103
00:09:24.049 --> 00:09:25.389
She does.

104
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.230
Do you know Baek Seung Gi?

105
00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.029
Baek Seung Gi?

106
00:09:33.929 --> 00:09:34.970
Who's that?

107
00:09:35.529 --> 00:09:37.499
He was the planning team's manager who created Gangsu gochujang.

108
00:09:38.399 --> 00:09:40.740
Mom told me to find out about her, so I did some digging.

109
00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:43.340
I found out that Baek June...

110
00:09:44.139 --> 00:09:45.409
is Baek Seung Gi's daughter.

111
00:09:46.639 --> 00:09:48.549
Really? She's the daughter of the manager...

112
00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:50.850
that created our gochujang?

113
00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.019
Gosh, that's great news.

114
00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.620
We don't even need to look any further.

115
00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.560
It's a great idea to have someone like that as a daughter-in-law.

116
00:09:58.960 --> 00:09:59.990
Don't you think so too?

117
00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:02.659
That scum. Why did he have to meet a woman like that?

118
00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:06.529
- What? - It's not going to happen.

119
00:10:07.029 --> 00:10:09.929
Pyeongang or not, we're never going to speak of her again.

120
00:10:10.399 --> 00:10:11.600
- Do you understand? - Oh, my.

121
00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:17.740
Gosh, what's wrong with him?

122
00:10:18.509 --> 00:10:21.649
If he created our gochujang, he contributed a lot to the company.

123
00:10:22.149 --> 00:10:23.679
When the company was having a hard time,

124
00:10:24.409 --> 00:10:26.379
it was the gochujang that saved us all.

125
00:10:28.519 --> 00:10:31.889
Anyhow, the fortuneteller told me they were destined to be.

126
00:10:32.659 --> 00:10:34.019
He was right.

127
00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:38.129
Gosh, Mother. Stop visiting the fortuneteller.

128
00:10:38.499 --> 00:10:42.269
Baek June won't save Hyuk. She'll only eat him up.

129
00:10:44.799 --> 00:10:46.070
Eat him up?

130
00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.240
What do you mean?

131
00:10:53.379 --> 00:10:56.149
I'm taking off today. I'm in a deep sleep.

132
00:10:56.649 --> 00:10:59.749
Don't knock on the door. Don't wake me up.

133
00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:35.190
Does Hyuk know that she's Baek Seung Gi's daughter?

134
00:11:36.419 --> 00:11:37.789
He didn't at first.

135
00:11:38.659 --> 00:11:40.320
Gosh, that jerk.

136
00:11:40.519 --> 00:11:41.789
There are so many other women.

137
00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:45.799
How could he stay close with the betrayer's daughter?

138
00:11:47.759 --> 00:11:48.799
Is there anything...

139
00:11:49.299 --> 00:11:50.700
that I need to know?

140
00:11:51.639 --> 00:11:53.570
If there is, please tell me.

141
00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.370
There's nothing more to know.

142
00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.740
You should talk to him.

143
00:11:58.210 --> 00:11:59.679
Make him break up with her.

144
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:04.009
Tell him that if he ignores my words again, I won't...

145
00:12:06.749 --> 00:12:08.289
spare his life.

146
00:12:09.749 --> 00:12:10.820
Do you understand?

147
00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:13.060
Yes, sir.

148
00:12:32.909 --> 00:12:34.179
June's mom?

149
00:13:05.179 --> 00:13:06.779
Mr. Kim, take care of this.

150
00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.879
Yes, just keep doing it.

151
00:13:10.779 --> 00:13:11.779
What?

152
00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.850
- About what I told you... - Yes.

153
00:13:16.049 --> 00:13:18.460
- Yes. - I have something to ask you...

154
00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:30.100
Let's just say I understand...

155
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.070
what happened to June's father. He was a lacking person.

156
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:38.139
But why would you hurt June too?

157
00:13:40.679 --> 00:13:41.710
I know...

158
00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:44.149
what you did to my husband.

159
00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:47.779
How dare you speak of bribery in front of my daughter?

160
00:13:50.519 --> 00:13:51.720
If you talk about bribery...

161
00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.659
and hurt June again,

162
00:13:55.659 --> 00:13:56.659
I will...

163
00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:00.029
no longer stay still, Mr. Seol.

164
00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:03.769
If you don't want to...

165
00:14:04.799 --> 00:14:07.769
bring up the Gangsu Chicken incident and cause trouble,

166
00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:10.940
don't make my daughter suffer anymore.

167
00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:16.649
Shouldn't we...

168
00:14:18.049 --> 00:14:19.879
redress what happened then?

169
00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:31.399
Do you think...

170
00:14:31.929 --> 00:14:33.600
you have the right to say such a thing?

171
00:14:39.639 --> 00:14:40.700
Take this...

172
00:14:41.139 --> 00:14:45.080
and stop making objections regarding the oil issue, okay?

173
00:14:46.139 --> 00:14:47.240
The chairman...

174
00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:50.279
has his eyes on you.

175
00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:52.179
So you'd better watch out.

176
00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.360
Goodness.

177
00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:07.100
(Yetteo Chicken)

178
00:15:28.249 --> 00:15:29.590
We delivered the message.

179
00:16:11.529 --> 00:16:12.560
What are you doing?

180
00:16:13.159 --> 00:16:14.429
Cleaning.

181
00:16:15.029 --> 00:16:16.100
Cleaning?

182
00:16:16.529 --> 00:16:18.769
I was cleaning...

183
00:16:18.769 --> 00:16:21.039
and Hyuk asked me...

184
00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.139
if there was anything he could help.

185
00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.110
I said it was okay,

186
00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:27.610
but then my knees hurt, so we were taking a rest for a second.

187
00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:52.070
(Executive Director's Office)

188
00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:15.590
Hey.

189
00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:17.659
Why did June's mom come out from Mr. Seol's office?

190
00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:21.169
I'll tell you later.

191
00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:23.570
Hey.

192
00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:28.239
The chairman called me in this morning.

193
00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:31.909
He wants you to end things with June.

194
00:17:36.179 --> 00:17:39.080
I think your brother reported him about June's dad.

195
00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:41.850
I told you...

196
00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:44.120
not to ignore your brother's warning.

197
00:18:10.209 --> 00:18:15.090
(I'm having a deep sleep at the moment. Don't knock the door.)

198
00:18:20.459 --> 00:18:22.429
I came to make some side dishes for you.

199
00:18:22.429 --> 00:18:23.860
Open the door.

200
00:18:33.969 --> 00:18:35.709
Your dad isn't that kind of a person.

201
00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:37.570
Bribery?

202
00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:39.540
That doesn't make sense at all.

203
00:18:40.879 --> 00:18:43.280
If he had been the type to care only about his interest,

204
00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:45.120
he wouldn't have died like that.

205
00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:49.219
So June, trust your dad.

206
00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:50.590
He is not...

207
00:18:51.189 --> 00:18:52.760
that kind of a person.

208
00:18:57.530 --> 00:18:59.560
(I'm having a deep sleep at the moment. Don't knock the door.)

209
00:19:05.639 --> 00:19:07.500
I'll leave these in front of the door.

210
00:19:08.909 --> 00:19:11.139
Put them in the fridge before they go bad.

211
00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.510
I'll come back again...

212
00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:18.550
when you feel like talking.

213
00:19:31.199 --> 00:19:32.229
Mom.

214
00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:50.850
I know.

215
00:19:52.879 --> 00:19:54.790
I know what you're thinking, but it's not true.

216
00:19:56.649 --> 00:19:58.760
There's no one as good as your dad.

217
00:19:59.989 --> 00:20:01.020
I guarantee.

218
00:21:55.709 --> 00:21:56.770
What's up?

219
00:21:57.370 --> 00:21:58.679
You really have guts for this.

220
00:22:00.239 --> 00:22:01.709
For how many years have you been doing this every day?

221
00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:04.149
About 11 years.

222
00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:05.780
11 years.

223
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:08.719
So it's since that incident.

224
00:22:15.489 --> 00:22:16.489
What's your point?

225
00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:17.929
June is the person I like.

226
00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.429
I won't stay still...

227
00:22:21.429 --> 00:22:23.699
if you threaten her with such a dirty trick one more time.

228
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:25.870
What?

229
00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:29.770
And stop ratting on stuff to Dad.

230
00:22:30.909 --> 00:22:32.879
Don't you think you're too old for that?

231
00:22:34.409 --> 00:22:35.610
Why this punk...

232
00:22:35.709 --> 00:22:37.250
Don't do it ever again.

233
00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:45.790
Bye.

234
00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:50.050
Why are you here again?

235
00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:53.879
I thought about it, and what you told me doesn't make sense.

236
00:24:55.449 --> 00:24:56.850
Are you hiding something from me?

237
00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:00.989
No, I'm not.

238
00:25:01.429 --> 00:25:02.929
About my dad receiving bribes.

239
00:25:04.229 --> 00:25:07.830
If that's all you can tell me, what are the things you can't tell?

240
00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:10.030
There isn't anything like that.

241
00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.939
Yes, there is. There's something.

242
00:25:14.239 --> 00:25:16.370
Please tell me the truth, Mr. Jang.

243
00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:18.780
- Gosh, seriously. - Mr. Jang!

244
00:25:19.209 --> 00:25:20.280
Mr. Jang.

245
00:25:21.179 --> 00:25:23.810
Mr. Jang, please tell me. Mr. Jang!

246
00:25:24.879 --> 00:25:27.580
I'm sorry. You'd better go.

247
00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:30.689
I know you're distressed too.

248
00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:32.790
That's why you should tell me.

249
00:25:33.959 --> 00:25:36.889
I'll wait right here until you tell me the truth.

250
00:25:37.429 --> 00:25:39.800
Mr. Jang. Mr. Jang!

251
00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:59.250
What are you doing now? Do you know what time it is?

252
00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:03.290
I'm sorry. It's not that I didn't come to work.

253
00:26:03.949 --> 00:26:06.389
I came to work, but something urgent came up, so...

254
00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:09.030
You're an intern, and you are not doing what you have to do.

255
00:26:09.129 --> 00:26:10.189
You're always away from your desk.

256
00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:11.959
- You get smart with me... - Excuse me.

257
00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.629
It's an important call. Wait a minute.

258
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:16.870
Yes, Mr. Jang.

259
00:26:17.169 --> 00:26:18.939
Gosh, the world has become much easier to live in.

260
00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:22.010
You can answer the phone while your boss is talking. It's gotten better.

261
00:26:22.439 --> 00:26:23.639
What? June?

262
00:26:25.209 --> 00:26:27.879
Yes, I get it. I'll be there soon.

263
00:26:28.409 --> 00:26:29.610
Where are you going?

264
00:26:29.709 --> 00:26:32.379
Mr. Jang called me urgently. I have to go.

265
00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:34.280
I'll be right back. Thank you.

266
00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:35.620
Well, it's...

267
00:26:36.419 --> 00:26:39.760
The third-generation guy works at this company so freely.

268
00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:43.330
It's just like the tail wagging the dog, isn't it?

269
00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:46.929
I called you because I think she may faint.

270
00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:49.330
Come and take her now, please.

271
00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:56.840
- I'll go. - No, I'll go.

272
00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:58.040
June...

273
00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:01.979
doesn't know that you're aware of this situation yet.

274
00:27:03.409 --> 00:27:05.350
If you step forward here and interfere in this situation,

275
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:06.949
how would she feel?

276
00:27:07.449 --> 00:27:08.489
Well...

277
00:27:14.219 --> 00:27:15.360
Wouldn't she like that?

278
00:27:17.189 --> 00:27:19.959
That's why I'm going. You'd better stay here.

279
00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:58.899
What are you doing here?

280
00:29:06.399 --> 00:29:07.469
You don't need to know.

281
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:09.870
Even if you do this,

282
00:29:10.239 --> 00:29:12.679
no one would tell you the truth.

283
00:29:12.879 --> 00:29:14.040
Who knows?

284
00:29:15.209 --> 00:29:17.649
Someone might tell me if I hold out.

285
00:29:17.979 --> 00:29:20.080
To tell the truth to one person,

286
00:29:20.449 --> 00:29:22.489
many people may have to suffer.

287
00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:24.620
Haven't you thought about it?

288
00:29:27.459 --> 00:29:29.229
The reason he can't tell the truth...

289
00:29:29.659 --> 00:29:32.399
is not because he's bad, but because he's weak.

290
00:29:33.229 --> 00:29:34.260
So?

291
00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:37.129
Even though they hide the truth...

292
00:29:37.629 --> 00:29:39.800
and make a scapegoat of someone, do I have to endure it?

293
00:29:40.439 --> 00:29:42.870
Even when that scapegoat is my dad, do I have to look the other way?

294
00:29:43.969 --> 00:29:45.040
Can you do that?

295
00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:48.310
Can you still do that if it's your dad?

296
00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:54.280
Dad.

297
00:29:56.649 --> 00:29:58.719
So get your armor and fight.

298
00:29:59.489 --> 00:30:01.429
You can't defeat anyone in this condition.

299
00:30:02.429 --> 00:30:03.760
If you live recklessly like this,

300
00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.429
you'll get nothing after all.

301
00:30:06.629 --> 00:30:07.659
The truth.

302
00:30:09.429 --> 00:30:10.669
I'll get the truth.

303
00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:13.739
And that will make me strong.

304
00:30:21.479 --> 00:30:22.550
Do as you wish.

305
00:30:52.933 --> 00:30:54.263
This is buy 1 get 1.

306
00:31:16.522 --> 00:31:18.693
Would you like to have this?

307
00:31:21.622 --> 00:31:22.622
What's this?

308
00:31:23.993 --> 00:31:25.263
I bought one and got one for free.

309
00:31:25.263 --> 00:31:26.292
Excuse me.

310
00:31:26.963 --> 00:31:28.802
I think there's a misunderstanding.

311
00:31:29.132 --> 00:31:32.032
I don't like drinking to the point where I need to drink this.

312
00:31:32.602 --> 00:31:33.632
About the other day...

313
00:31:36.072 --> 00:31:38.072
Yes, I made a mistake that day.

314
00:31:38.413 --> 00:31:39.473
Still,

315
00:31:39.913 --> 00:31:42.042
you don't have to treat me like I'm a heavy drinker.

316
00:31:43.013 --> 00:31:44.342
I'm not treating you like that.

317
00:31:44.852 --> 00:31:46.782
I got one for free, that's why.

318
00:31:49.153 --> 00:31:50.183
Goodness.

319
00:31:55.963 --> 00:31:59.032
I refuse your free item.

320
00:31:59.663 --> 00:32:00.663
Do you understand?

321
00:32:03.832 --> 00:32:05.772
As you like.

322
00:32:09.403 --> 00:32:12.013
Gosh, I can't believe this. What is that guy?

323
00:32:20.953 --> 00:32:22.022
What's happening?

324
00:32:23.522 --> 00:32:24.552
Gosh, seriously.

325
00:32:25.052 --> 00:32:26.092
Excuse me...

326
00:32:32.332 --> 00:32:33.592
What shall I do?

327
00:32:34.862 --> 00:32:36.562
Gosh, really.

328
00:32:50.983 --> 00:32:52.713
Hello, Je Hoon.

329
00:32:59.223 --> 00:33:00.223
Lean on me.

330
00:33:01.423 --> 00:33:02.423
What?

331
00:33:05.433 --> 00:33:06.433
Okay.

332
00:33:22.413 --> 00:33:23.482
Stay still for a moment.

333
00:33:27.212 --> 00:33:28.223
Wait a minute.

334
00:33:38.032 --> 00:33:39.032
Okay.

335
00:33:48.302 --> 00:33:49.302
Thank you.

336
00:33:50.473 --> 00:33:51.473
Yes.

337
00:34:17.203 --> 00:34:19.032
- Do you... - Yes, I have time.

338
00:34:23.802 --> 00:34:26.373
No, do you know how I can contact June's mother?

339
00:34:27.782 --> 00:34:28.782
What?

340
00:34:36.382 --> 00:34:37.422
What is this?

341
00:34:38.322 --> 00:34:41.793
What we heard in front of Mr. Seol's room kept bothering me.

342
00:34:42.523 --> 00:34:45.192
I mean the story about June's father accepting bribes.

343
00:34:45.862 --> 00:34:47.632
So I did some research...

344
00:34:47.632 --> 00:34:50.603
on the subcontract factories at that time.

345
00:34:51.203 --> 00:34:54.743
Everyone only had good things to say about Baek Seung Gi.

346
00:34:55.243 --> 00:34:57.342
There was something strange.

347
00:34:58.172 --> 00:35:00.413
Whenever we asked them about the bribes, they wouldn't say anything.

348
00:35:00.942 --> 00:35:01.982
They wouldn't say anything?

349
00:35:01.982 --> 00:35:05.752
They wouldn't say a word about whether he accepted bribes or not.

350
00:35:06.212 --> 00:35:07.252
What does that mean?

351
00:35:07.313 --> 00:35:08.422
Don't you understand?

352
00:35:08.782 --> 00:35:12.252
It means that they're being pressured by someone.

353
00:35:12.922 --> 00:35:15.893
If June's father really accepted bribes,

354
00:35:16.192 --> 00:35:17.393
they would have insulted him.

355
00:35:17.493 --> 00:35:19.232
They wouldn't stay quiet.

356
00:35:20.032 --> 00:35:21.163
There's something.

357
00:35:21.362 --> 00:35:24.032
There's something major behind this.

358
00:35:34.056 --> 00:35:37.288

<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

359
00:35:47.822 --> 00:35:49.393
Why is he still here so late?

360
00:35:50.822 --> 00:35:51.962
He must be sorry.

361
00:35:53.893 --> 00:35:56.203
Bring me some coffee.

362
00:35:58.703 --> 00:35:59.703
What?

363
00:36:02.442 --> 00:36:04.773
It doesn't seem like he did it on purpose, but why is it so annoying?

364
00:36:38.842 --> 00:36:40.612
Mr. Jang.

365
00:36:44.913 --> 00:36:45.913
Mr. Jang.

366
00:36:46.552 --> 00:36:48.353
Stop it and just go home.

367
00:36:49.023 --> 00:36:50.023
It's cold outside.

368
00:36:51.353 --> 00:36:52.353
Mr. Jang.

369
00:36:52.993 --> 00:36:54.052
Mr. Jang.

370
00:36:55.922 --> 00:36:57.163
I'll be here again tomorrow.

371
00:36:58.393 --> 00:36:59.732
I'll see you tomorrow.

372
00:37:25.893 --> 00:37:26.922
Mom.

373
00:37:29.223 --> 00:37:30.592
Why are you here again?

374
00:37:31.663 --> 00:37:32.793
Is something wrong?

375
00:37:35.002 --> 00:37:36.132
Are you crazy?

376
00:37:36.833 --> 00:37:38.732
Why would you go to the Saeman factory?

377
00:37:44.002 --> 00:37:45.143
You told me to trust Dad.

378
00:37:46.172 --> 00:37:47.273
You said he was innocent.

379
00:37:49.083 --> 00:37:50.782
I need to know the truth.

380
00:37:51.612 --> 00:37:53.612
I want to know what really happened...

381
00:37:54.013 --> 00:37:55.183
when Dad left the company.

382
00:37:55.382 --> 00:37:56.922
It's enough...

383
00:37:56.922 --> 00:37:58.353
as long as we believe him.

384
00:37:58.552 --> 00:38:00.652
It could be enough for you, but it isn't for me.

385
00:38:01.822 --> 00:38:04.163
Your father already passed away, and it's all over.

386
00:38:04.263 --> 00:38:06.433
What use is there to find out what really happened now?

387
00:38:06.433 --> 00:38:07.433
Mom.

388
00:38:09.833 --> 00:38:12.072
Do you know how I've been living until now?

389
00:38:13.402 --> 00:38:16.672
Do you know how I've endured my life filled with part-time jobs?

390
00:38:19.442 --> 00:38:20.612
I'm lost.

391
00:38:22.342 --> 00:38:24.112
If I don't find out what happened,

392
00:38:26.212 --> 00:38:27.853
I won't be able to go forward.

393
00:38:30.623 --> 00:38:31.652
Are you saying...

394
00:38:33.192 --> 00:38:35.123
that I should also see you getting hurt?

395
00:38:35.922 --> 00:38:37.663
I'm just trying to prove Dad's innocence.

396
00:38:38.163 --> 00:38:39.433
Why would I get hurt?

397
00:38:39.793 --> 00:38:40.993
Don't you know...

398
00:38:41.532 --> 00:38:44.263
how much trouble Gangsu Group caused even after him leaving the company?

399
00:38:44.373 --> 00:38:45.433
I know.

400
00:38:46.572 --> 00:38:48.373
That's why I can't stay still like this.

401
00:38:51.873 --> 00:38:52.973
Don't be afraid.

402
00:38:53.273 --> 00:38:54.612
I have nothing to lose.

403
00:39:01.353 --> 00:39:02.422
Please.

404
00:39:03.123 --> 00:39:04.123
June,

405
00:39:04.853 --> 00:39:06.853
let's just not get our lives mingled up with Gangsu Group.

406
00:39:07.252 --> 00:39:09.063
Find a proper job now.

407
00:39:09.362 --> 00:39:11.362
Stop doing part-time jobs.

408
00:39:14.402 --> 00:39:15.402
I'll do that.

409
00:39:16.532 --> 00:39:17.632
I'll do that...

410
00:39:18.632 --> 00:39:20.172
after I make things right for Dad.

411
00:39:22.802 --> 00:39:23.842
Mom.

412
00:39:26.172 --> 00:39:27.172
Don't make me stop...

413
00:39:28.013 --> 00:39:29.043
until then.

414
00:39:49.833 --> 00:39:50.833
Was it you?

415
00:39:51.502 --> 00:39:52.902
Did you call my mom?

416
00:39:53.802 --> 00:39:54.802
Yes.

417
00:39:55.802 --> 00:39:58.143
- Why? - To stop your stupid behavior.

418
00:39:59.313 --> 00:40:02.413
Why do you care whatever I do?

419
00:40:03.842 --> 00:40:04.882
What about you?

420
00:40:05.482 --> 00:40:06.482
Why did you do that?

421
00:40:07.583 --> 00:40:09.723
Whether I cleaned after Hyuk's mess or not,

422
00:40:10.282 --> 00:40:11.623
why did it matter to you...

423
00:40:11.623 --> 00:40:14.223
that you kept on nagging about all the little things? Why?

424
00:40:14.623 --> 00:40:15.623
That's because...

425
00:40:18.632 --> 00:40:20.132
you were so pathetic.

426
00:40:21.962 --> 00:40:23.032
That's why I'm doing this too.

427
00:40:23.333 --> 00:40:24.773
I think what you're doing is pathetic.

428
00:40:25.773 --> 00:40:28.402
Let's say that you find out the truth.

429
00:40:29.342 --> 00:40:31.513
What will you do against Gangsu Group then?

430
00:40:32.243 --> 00:40:33.243
Do you think...

431
00:40:34.013 --> 00:40:36.743
that Hyuk will take your side and handle things for you?

432
00:40:38.083 --> 00:40:39.413
Why would you mention Hyuk?

433
00:40:39.712 --> 00:40:40.813
Don't expect anything.

434
00:40:41.353 --> 00:40:42.382
Hyuk is...

435
00:40:43.123 --> 00:40:44.623
just another member of Gangsu Group.

436
00:40:44.822 --> 00:40:45.853
I know that.

437
00:40:46.152 --> 00:40:47.962
Only you'll get hurt and left alone.

438
00:40:50.462 --> 00:40:51.493
How do you know...

439
00:40:52.032 --> 00:40:53.263
so well?

440
00:40:56.402 --> 00:40:57.433
Your father wasn't...

441
00:40:58.732 --> 00:41:00.132
the only person who was involved in something like this.

442
00:41:03.502 --> 00:41:04.513
June.

443
00:41:06.813 --> 00:41:07.913
Please stop.

444
00:41:12.052 --> 00:41:13.652
They called...

445
00:41:13.652 --> 00:41:14.853
our company.

446
00:41:14.853 --> 00:41:16.052
Really?

447
00:41:16.052 --> 00:41:18.252
I can't believe that.

448
00:41:18.252 --> 00:41:19.523
Here's your food.

449
00:41:19.723 --> 00:41:21.723
- Here. - Thank you.

450
00:41:25.763 --> 00:41:26.833
This could be...

451
00:41:27.532 --> 00:41:28.933
your last chance.

452
00:41:31.132 --> 00:41:33.402
Your last chance to stop feeling guilty.

453
00:41:35.743 --> 00:41:37.743
I think you would have been feeling guilty...

454
00:41:38.373 --> 00:41:40.413
for all these years.

455
00:41:41.743 --> 00:41:42.813
Am I wrong?

456
00:41:43.382 --> 00:41:45.382
Why are you doing this to me?

457
00:41:46.353 --> 00:41:47.353
If I open my mouth,

458
00:41:47.652 --> 00:41:50.482
Mr. Seol, you'll also be in trouble. Don't you know that?

459
00:41:51.953 --> 00:41:52.953
I also want...

460
00:41:53.893 --> 00:41:55.922
to join you.

461
00:41:57.493 --> 00:41:58.493
What do you mean?

462
00:41:58.993 --> 00:42:01.032
Will you be able to protect me this time?

463
00:42:01.763 --> 00:42:02.763
No.

464
00:42:03.703 --> 00:42:05.433
I can't protect you.

465
00:42:06.473 --> 00:42:07.473
In the end,

466
00:42:08.072 --> 00:42:10.842
everyone should pay the price for their own sins.

467
00:42:21.683 --> 00:42:22.882
I prepared this,

468
00:42:23.282 --> 00:42:24.953
but it's your choice to make.

469
00:42:26.422 --> 00:42:27.422
I already...

470
00:42:28.192 --> 00:42:29.393
made a choice.

471
00:43:01.723 --> 00:43:02.962
Thanks.

472
00:43:13.773 --> 00:43:15.473
Can you tell me...

473
00:43:17.203 --> 00:43:19.043
what really happened to Baek Seung Gi?

474
00:43:20.112 --> 00:43:22.043
What does this have to do with Gangsu Chicken?

475
00:43:22.712 --> 00:43:25.282
What is the price we have to pay for?

476
00:43:26.782 --> 00:43:27.953
And why is Mr. Jang...

477
00:43:28.822 --> 00:43:30.453
in such agony?

478
00:43:32.793 --> 00:43:33.793
I need to know.

479
00:43:34.723 --> 00:43:35.723
Please tell me.

480
00:43:51.973 --> 00:43:54.683
You might lose one of the two.

481
00:43:55.683 --> 00:43:58.453
After I tell you this, you may lose...

482
00:43:59.052 --> 00:44:02.052
either your father or June forever.

483
00:44:02.282 --> 00:44:03.422
Are you okay with that?

484
00:44:15.603 --> 00:44:16.603
Hyuk.

485
00:44:23.802 --> 00:44:24.842
You're late.

486
00:44:28.583 --> 00:44:30.282
Internship must be hard.

487
00:44:31.612 --> 00:44:32.913
You look pale.

488
00:44:34.382 --> 00:44:35.422
Are you all right?

489
00:44:36.822 --> 00:44:38.692
You said you were going to rest today.

490
00:44:39.953 --> 00:44:40.953
Did you rest well?

491
00:44:41.993 --> 00:44:42.993
Of course.

492
00:44:44.092 --> 00:44:45.132
I rested well.

493
00:44:48.132 --> 00:44:49.203
June,

494
00:44:51.433 --> 00:44:52.502
am I still...

495
00:44:54.402 --> 00:44:55.502
a friend to you?

496
00:45:00.413 --> 00:45:01.413
Of course.

497
00:45:03.513 --> 00:45:05.752
You and I are friends.

498
00:45:07.313 --> 00:45:08.422
It ends there.

499
00:45:09.422 --> 00:45:10.482
It's just a friendship.

500
00:45:11.192 --> 00:45:12.252
That's it.

501
00:45:14.922 --> 00:45:16.023
Then can I...

502
00:45:17.592 --> 00:45:18.692
hug you as a friend?

503
00:45:20.793 --> 00:45:21.802
What?

504
00:45:28.802 --> 00:45:29.873
Hey.

505
00:45:31.572 --> 00:45:32.773
What's the matter?

506
00:45:33.942 --> 00:45:35.782
Did something happen to you today?

507
00:45:36.842 --> 00:45:38.152
Yes.

508
00:45:41.223 --> 00:45:43.683
What is it? What happened?

509
00:45:44.853 --> 00:45:46.293
It's nothing. It's just...

510
00:45:48.092 --> 00:45:49.462
I found out today...

511
00:45:50.962 --> 00:45:52.663
why she kept...

512
00:45:53.362 --> 00:45:54.763
drawing a line.

513
00:45:56.462 --> 00:45:57.703
Don't take this the wrong way.

514
00:45:59.132 --> 00:46:00.132
This is...

515
00:46:01.773 --> 00:46:02.873
a hug as a friend.

516
00:46:04.572 --> 00:46:05.612
And...

517
00:46:07.172 --> 00:46:08.183
this is...

518
00:46:11.052 --> 00:46:12.382
a pat as a friend.

519
00:46:29.502 --> 00:46:30.563
Mr. Kwon,

520
00:46:31.402 --> 00:46:33.433
I think we should leave today.

521
00:46:34.273 --> 00:46:35.302
Yes, ma'am.

522
00:46:56.962 --> 00:46:58.032
June.

523
00:46:59.362 --> 00:47:02.433
Do you really need to do this?

524
00:47:04.163 --> 00:47:06.873
If I don't do this for Dad,

525
00:47:08.402 --> 00:47:09.902
I won't be able to do anything.

526
00:47:11.873 --> 00:47:12.873
I'm leaving.

527
00:47:20.353 --> 00:47:22.583
- Hello. - Hello. You're early.

528
00:47:30.462 --> 00:47:31.793
Hello, Mr. Jang.

529
00:47:36.163 --> 00:47:37.563
I'll wait here...

530
00:47:38.433 --> 00:47:41.103
until you tell me everything.

531
00:47:42.703 --> 00:47:43.802
I'll wait here.

532
00:47:50.382 --> 00:47:51.413
Don't give up.

533
00:47:53.112 --> 00:47:54.313
Don't give up, Baek June.

534
00:48:05.433 --> 00:48:06.493
Hyuk.

535
00:48:08.302 --> 00:48:09.362
Hyuk.

536
00:48:25.313 --> 00:48:27.723
I have something to talk to you concerning June's dad.

537
00:48:29.052 --> 00:48:30.652
Not you too.

538
00:48:31.652 --> 00:48:33.893
I don't have anything to tell you. Take her and leave.

539
00:48:34.223 --> 00:48:35.993
If you're hiding this because of Gangsu Group,

540
00:48:36.592 --> 00:48:37.833
you can trust me and be honest.

541
00:48:38.732 --> 00:48:41.163
I'll make sure you don't get disadvantages.

542
00:48:42.402 --> 00:48:45.433
Being the chairman's son doesn't mean you can do anything.

543
00:48:46.273 --> 00:48:48.873
The world is not as simple as you think.

544
00:48:49.273 --> 00:48:50.672
Do you think I'm joking around?

545
00:48:51.773 --> 00:48:53.373
Don't act up for her.

546
00:48:54.172 --> 00:48:55.482
It's not going to do any good for you.

547
00:48:55.683 --> 00:48:56.743
Her dad's problem is...

548
00:48:57.782 --> 00:48:58.782
also my problem.

549
00:49:01.353 --> 00:49:04.393
It's not only about her dad. It's about your dad too.

550
00:49:05.453 --> 00:49:06.652
That's why I can't tell you.

551
00:49:06.853 --> 00:49:09.322
If that's the case, I really need to know.

552
00:49:09.422 --> 00:49:10.893
I told you I can't.

553
00:49:13.763 --> 00:49:14.802
Mr. Jang,

554
00:49:16.032 --> 00:49:17.732
you know how I helped you...

555
00:49:18.802 --> 00:49:19.902
with your cupbap.

556
00:49:20.933 --> 00:49:22.143
I went against my father...

557
00:49:23.273 --> 00:49:24.342
to make it work.

558
00:49:26.842 --> 00:49:28.143
I don't think like my father.

559
00:49:28.782 --> 00:49:30.243
If something has been wronged,

560
00:49:30.712 --> 00:49:33.683
I think that now is still not late to make it right.

561
00:49:35.853 --> 00:49:38.123
Please give me a chance to do that, Mr. Jang.

562
00:49:45.862 --> 00:49:47.902
Maybe, this could be the last chance...

563
00:49:49.203 --> 00:49:51.273
to get rid of your guilt.

564
00:49:57.402 --> 00:49:59.212
Baek Seung Gi was kicked out.

565
00:50:01.112 --> 00:50:02.982
He wanted to get rid of the custom...

566
00:50:03.643 --> 00:50:04.982
of receiving bribes from subcontractors.

567
00:50:06.282 --> 00:50:07.453
So he brought up...

568
00:50:08.482 --> 00:50:10.052
the issue to the company...

569
00:50:11.252 --> 00:50:12.793
and people started discussing about it...

570
00:50:14.052 --> 00:50:15.322
when the superiors stopped him.

571
00:50:17.623 --> 00:50:18.692
The superiors?

572
00:50:19.663 --> 00:50:21.462
If this issue were to be brought up,

573
00:50:22.132 --> 00:50:24.132
many would've gotten hurt.

574
00:50:26.232 --> 00:50:29.672
Rather than reconstructing the company just to break an old custom,

575
00:50:30.172 --> 00:50:32.842
they decided that it'd be easier...

576
00:50:33.743 --> 00:50:35.543
to get rid of him.

577
00:50:37.442 --> 00:50:38.482
So?

578
00:50:41.223 --> 00:50:42.882
They say that a cornered stone meets the mason's chisel.

579
00:50:44.223 --> 00:50:45.223
One day,

580
00:50:46.192 --> 00:50:49.422
the chairman ordered me directly...

581
00:50:50.163 --> 00:50:53.192
to testify falsely...

582
00:50:55.032 --> 00:50:56.933
that I bribed Baek Seung Gi...

583
00:50:57.502 --> 00:50:58.703
regularly.

584
00:51:01.043 --> 00:51:02.172
He said if I didn't,

585
00:51:03.973 --> 00:51:06.043
he would cancel the contract with my factory.

586
00:51:09.382 --> 00:51:10.442
That's how...

587
00:51:10.842 --> 00:51:14.623
I betrayed Baek Seung Gi.

588
00:51:18.822 --> 00:51:20.092
So that I could live.

589
00:51:22.123 --> 00:51:25.862
He never received bribes.

590
00:51:27.393 --> 00:51:28.402
Rather,

591
00:51:29.263 --> 00:51:31.232
whenever our contract was in danger of being cancelled...

592
00:51:32.203 --> 00:51:34.802
he would argue with his superiors saying that...

593
00:51:35.143 --> 00:51:37.572
he couldn't betray a partner he'd been working for a long time.

594
00:51:38.942 --> 00:51:39.973
I...

595
00:51:41.913 --> 00:51:42.982
I...

596
00:51:44.313 --> 00:51:45.752
I did that to save myself.

597
00:51:52.652 --> 00:51:53.692
I'm sorry.

598
00:51:55.362 --> 00:51:56.523
I'm truly sorry.

599
00:51:58.862 --> 00:51:59.862
I...

600
00:52:00.862 --> 00:52:02.632
I feel ashamed to see you.

601
00:52:16.083 --> 00:52:17.712
(Manager Baek Seung Gi)

602
00:52:33.163 --> 00:52:35.302
(Manager Baek Seung Gi)

603
00:53:06.962 --> 00:53:08.802
He took all the blame...

604
00:53:09.002 --> 00:53:10.263
and left the company.

605
00:53:11.402 --> 00:53:13.873
He was falsely charged of bribery with dishonor.

606
00:53:21.813 --> 00:53:23.712
Who was behind all this?

607
00:53:28.953 --> 00:53:30.083
Was it my dad?

608
00:54:13.632 --> 00:54:14.703
Are you done talking with him?

609
00:54:15.663 --> 00:54:16.663
Yes.

610
00:54:16.933 --> 00:54:18.032
Did you hear...

611
00:54:19.002 --> 00:54:20.132
everything you wanted to hear?

612
00:54:22.273 --> 00:54:23.273
Yes.

613
00:54:29.513 --> 00:54:30.712
How did you know?

614
00:54:32.453 --> 00:54:33.453
I mean...

615
00:54:35.353 --> 00:54:37.623
Since when did you know about my dad?

616
00:54:38.293 --> 00:54:39.353
The same day as you.

617
00:54:40.652 --> 00:54:41.822
Did you hear it from your brother?

618
00:54:42.793 --> 00:54:43.793
Yes.

619
00:54:44.993 --> 00:54:45.993
Then...

620
00:54:47.362 --> 00:54:51.502
You must've heard that I was using you.

621
00:54:53.103 --> 00:54:54.103
Yes.

622
00:54:54.743 --> 00:54:56.203
Why did you do nothing about it?

623
00:54:58.612 --> 00:55:00.813
What if it's true?

624
00:55:01.482 --> 00:55:02.612
I know you're not.

625
00:55:05.152 --> 00:55:06.152
Even if...

626
00:55:07.552 --> 00:55:09.422
you really are using me,

627
00:55:09.882 --> 00:55:10.982
I can't help it.

628
00:55:12.052 --> 00:55:13.092
This all...

629
00:55:14.322 --> 00:55:16.092
happened because of my dad.

630
00:55:27.402 --> 00:55:28.402
My friend.

631
00:55:33.712 --> 00:55:34.782
My friend.

632
00:55:37.683 --> 00:55:39.083
My friend.

633
00:55:42.752 --> 00:55:43.953
Can I hug you...

634
00:55:48.293 --> 00:55:49.523
as a friend for just once?

635
00:56:17.252 --> 00:56:18.353
Thank you.

636
00:56:21.592 --> 00:56:23.763
I was able to hear that my dad was falsely accused...

637
00:56:25.962 --> 00:56:27.132
thanks to you.

638
00:56:37.873 --> 00:56:40.543
June, do you know?

639
00:56:41.942 --> 00:56:44.453
This is only the beginning.

640
00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:06.521
- Hi. - Are you out of your mind?

641
00:57:06.821 --> 00:57:08.791
Why are you in this together when you're supposed to stop her?

642
00:57:09.291 --> 00:57:10.330
Why should I stop her?

643
00:57:10.691 --> 00:57:12.501
I helped her hear what she wanted to hear.

644
00:57:12.901 --> 00:57:14.100
Is it that wrong?

645
00:57:14.301 --> 00:57:15.830
Don't you see what's going on?

646
00:57:16.030 --> 00:57:18.470
Your brother's taken measures at the mention of June's dad's name.

647
00:57:18.571 --> 00:57:20.801
Now, the chairman wants you to end things with June.

648
00:57:23.810 --> 00:57:25.981
That's why I don't understand it all the more.

649
00:57:27.041 --> 00:57:28.780
Don't you think they're hiding something behind?

650
00:57:29.711 --> 00:57:31.010
What will you do if they are?

651
00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:33.080
- I'll reveal it. - You should cover it.

652
00:57:35.921 --> 00:57:36.921
Je Hoon.

653
00:57:38.060 --> 00:57:39.120
What's your dream?

654
00:57:40.821 --> 00:57:42.260
Why are you asking about my dream all of a sudden?

655
00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:43.791
Then let me ask you again.

656
00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:46.861
What do you want to do in this company?

657
00:57:49.301 --> 00:57:50.430
Do you like this company?

658
00:57:50.631 --> 00:57:52.140
Are you happy working at Gangsu Group?

659
00:57:55.771 --> 00:57:57.370
No one feels happy working at a company.

660
00:57:57.780 --> 00:57:59.180
Can't you be?

661
00:58:00.211 --> 00:58:01.280
Tell me.

662
00:58:01.551 --> 00:58:02.751
For you to be happy,

663
00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:05.080
how should this company change?

664
00:58:06.421 --> 00:58:09.120
Why? Will you sing and dance again to bring a change?

665
00:58:09.691 --> 00:58:11.321
The cleaners' employment and the subcontractor issue...

666
00:58:11.861 --> 00:58:13.990
didn't get settled because of you.

667
00:58:14.091 --> 00:58:15.160
Don't be mistaken.

668
00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:17.961
To be exact, they got settled because you're the chairman's son.

669
00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:19.301
Tell me about it.

670
00:58:20.231 --> 00:58:22.171
That's why I'm wondering...

671
00:58:22.271 --> 00:58:24.740
if there's anything more to change while I'm still the chairman's son.

672
00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:28.970
- What? - I can prove that my dad's wrong...

673
00:58:29.441 --> 00:58:31.941
if things get better by changing.

674
00:58:33.310 --> 00:58:35.780
What are you thinking?

675
00:58:37.010 --> 00:58:38.821
Don't you want to see...

676
00:58:39.751 --> 00:58:41.450
my dad admitting his fault for once?

677
00:58:41.850 --> 00:58:43.051
I'm dying to see.

678
00:59:13.921 --> 00:59:16.521
What happened to our promotional partner?

679
00:59:16.521 --> 00:59:18.421
- Check here. - I called them and they're not...

680
00:59:18.421 --> 00:59:20.220
No, we need to get this done quickly.

681
00:59:20.421 --> 00:59:23.260
Come here, Hyun Joo. Hurry.

682
00:59:23.430 --> 00:59:25.100
Because we're afraid of the upper management.

683
00:59:25.801 --> 00:59:27.870
If we don't make good outcomes, we can't get promoted.

684
00:59:28.530 --> 00:59:29.600
Then...

685
00:59:30.001 --> 00:59:31.841
we'll get kicked out of the company in a split second.

686
00:59:32.970 --> 00:59:35.071
You don't share what you have when you do business.

687
00:59:35.271 --> 00:59:37.310
The weak are the prey of the strong. Don't you get it, you punk?

688
00:59:38.041 --> 00:59:41.481
If you don't eat, you get eaten. That's the way it is.

689
00:59:46.051 --> 00:59:47.651
No matter how much loyal you are to a company,

690
00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:50.450
you get thrown away like consumable goods in a second.

691
00:59:51.591 --> 00:59:53.361
It's the destiny of salarymen.

692
00:59:58.461 --> 00:59:59.501
What do you...

693
01:00:00.361 --> 01:00:01.600
plan to do now?

(Resume)

696
01:00:09.671 --> 01:00:11.441
Is the information right? My contact number...

697
01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:12.910
It's fine as long as I wrote my contact number right.

698
01:00:13.211 --> 01:00:15.711
By the way, what are you going to use these for?

699
01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:17.821
You're not going to use them for something weird, are you?

700
01:00:18.021 --> 01:00:19.950
I have a bad feeling about this.

701
01:00:20.551 --> 01:00:21.551
Please don't.

702
01:00:21.950 --> 01:00:23.151
I'll use them for a good purpose.

703
01:00:52.481 --> 01:00:53.881
You heard from Je Hoon, right?

704
01:00:55.251 --> 01:00:56.791
- Yes, Dad. - So?

705
01:00:57.890 --> 01:00:59.791
Did you end things with June?

706
01:01:01.191 --> 01:01:02.461
Before that, I'm curious about something.

707
01:01:03.830 --> 01:01:07.830
Why did you frame an innocent man and kick him out of the company?

708
01:01:09.071 --> 01:01:10.171
Who said...

709
01:01:10.571 --> 01:01:12.100
that Baek Seung Gi didn't do anything wrong?

710
01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:13.200
What did he do wrong?

711
01:01:14.941 --> 01:01:16.671
He pointed a sword at the company management...

712
01:01:17.211 --> 01:01:19.211
with a naive sense of ambition.

713
01:01:21.410 --> 01:01:23.751
You don't run a company with a sense of justice.

714
01:01:23.751 --> 01:01:25.280
A company must make profits.

715
01:01:27.821 --> 01:01:29.691
It needs people in order to make profits.

716
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:33.390
I couldn't shake the entire company for the sake of Baek Seung Gi.

717
01:01:35.691 --> 01:01:36.691
In the end,

718
01:01:37.291 --> 01:01:39.600
you chose money over a person.

719
01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:43.700
Sometimes, you need a small sacrifice...

720
01:01:44.330 --> 01:01:45.740
for the greater good.

721
01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:47.200
For who?

722
01:01:47.401 --> 01:01:49.410
For every member in the company.

723
01:01:49.611 --> 01:01:50.711
Not for you, Dad?

724
01:01:50.910 --> 01:01:52.080
The company is me.

725
01:01:57.381 --> 01:01:58.421
Okay.

726
01:01:59.350 --> 01:02:02.321
Father, do you remember the reward last time?

727
01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:04.791
Reward?

728
01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:08.961
You didn't forget about it, did you?

729
01:02:09.490 --> 01:02:12.131
You mentioned it after receiving the presidential award.

730
01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:15.001
I didn't forget about it. What do you want me to do?

731
01:02:15.671 --> 01:02:18.571
Do you need a house? Should I buy you a car?

732
01:02:20.001 --> 01:02:22.370
These are the hidden contributors behind the award.

733
01:02:24.881 --> 01:02:27.910
Please employ these people to the planning team.

734
01:02:29.410 --> 01:02:32.180
- Is that it? - Yes, that's it.

738
01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:03.251
I trust you to employ them. I'm leaving.

739
01:03:04.751 --> 01:03:05.821
Why won't you answer me?

740
01:03:06.981 --> 01:03:09.921
Did you end the relationship with that girl?

741
01:03:14.191 --> 01:03:16.191
June and I are just friends.

742
01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:19.501
She's my friend.

743
01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:22.271
She's my friend.

744
01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:25.171
Don't worry.

745
01:03:40.321 --> 01:03:44.691
I think Hyuk's crossing the line because he's in love with that girl.

746
01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:48.291
What do you mean?

747
01:04:11.450 --> 01:04:12.950
We have to get rid of her from the company...

748
01:04:13.751 --> 01:04:15.191
before Hyuk causes trouble again.

01:04:42.850 --> 01:04:43.950
Thank you.

752
01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:50.751
June, you're even good at making coffee. It's better than any cafe.

753
01:04:51.691 --> 01:04:53.660
You're off duty today. Didn't you go anywhere?

754
01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:56.490
I want to ask you something about Kwon Je Hoon.

755
01:04:57.430 --> 01:04:58.501
What about him?

756
01:04:59.830 --> 01:05:01.071
Does he have a girlfriend?

757
01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:04.801
I'm not sure.

758
01:05:06.071 --> 01:05:07.441
I think he doesn't have one.

759
01:05:08.071 --> 01:05:09.140
Why?

760
01:05:09.941 --> 01:05:12.740
Actually, last night...

761
01:05:13.611 --> 01:05:17.280
I was struggling because my heel got stuck in a manhole cover.

762
01:05:17.921 --> 01:05:19.381
He suddenly appeared...

763
01:05:19.881 --> 01:05:21.720
and took it out with his hands.

764
01:05:22.751 --> 01:05:23.791
Je Hoon did that?

765
01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:26.760
I can't believe that.

766
01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:29.791
He's not nice to women.

767
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:31.030
Right?

768
01:05:31.731 --> 01:05:34.001
I didn't think he was nice.

769
01:05:35.370 --> 01:05:37.501
That's why I felt...

770
01:05:38.341 --> 01:05:39.341
strange.

771
01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:44.841
Last time, he suddenly gave me some porridge.

772
01:05:45.881 --> 01:05:46.881
Porridge?

773
01:05:47.611 --> 01:05:48.910
He gave it to you?

774
01:05:49.481 --> 01:05:50.580
Do you think...

775
01:05:52.251 --> 01:05:53.421
he likes me?

776
01:05:56.321 --> 01:05:58.191
What do you think?

777
01:05:58.890 --> 01:06:01.361
You should know since you've known him for a long time.

778
01:06:03.030 --> 01:06:04.060
What about you?

779
01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:07.901
Aren't your feelings more important?

780
01:06:09.030 --> 01:06:10.071
What?

781
01:06:10.901 --> 01:06:12.100
I guess...

782
01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:17.270
How could you ask such a thing so directly? I'm embarrassed.

783
01:06:19.511 --> 01:06:21.610
Actually...

784
01:06:23.410 --> 01:06:24.480
Je Hoon.

785
01:06:34.431 --> 01:06:35.490
Was...

786
01:06:36.061 --> 01:06:37.291
Hyuk up here?

787
01:06:38.001 --> 01:06:39.501
He wasn't here.

788
01:06:44.001 --> 01:06:45.740
Where did he go? He won't even pick up the phone.

789
01:06:53.110 --> 01:06:54.181
What should I do?

790
01:06:55.181 --> 01:06:56.681
Did he hear everything?

791
01:06:57.950 --> 01:06:59.820
He's slow, so he wouldn't have heard anything.

792
01:07:18.001 --> 01:07:19.041
I'm sorry.

793
01:07:21.841 --> 01:07:22.841
Excuse me.

794
01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:30.051
Do you want this?

795
01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:32.881
What?

796
01:07:59.110 --> 01:08:01.110
Je Hoon, are you home?

797
01:08:04.011 --> 01:08:06.150
No matter how tired you are, you should change before you sleep.

798
01:08:06.650 --> 01:08:07.820
You'll catch a cold.

799
01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:11.061
Don't talk to me.

800
01:08:11.391 --> 01:08:12.421
Okay.

802
01:08:30.011 --> 01:08:31.041
Hyuk,

803
01:08:32.881 --> 01:08:34.110
how serious are you?

804
01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:35.580
What do you mean?

805
01:08:37.450 --> 01:08:38.650
What you told me earlier.

806
01:08:40.921 --> 01:08:42.921
Why? Are you curious?

807
01:08:43.851 --> 01:08:47.091
Look forward to tomorrow morning. You're going to be really surprised.

808
01:09:32.301 --> 01:09:36.070
I am Kim Ki Seob, and I'll be working here in the planning team.

809
01:09:36.610 --> 01:09:37.711
I'll work hard.

810
01:09:47.891 --> 01:09:48.950
Bravo.

811
01:09:49.891 --> 01:09:51.120
Did you make Hyuk do it?

812
01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:53.221
Do what?

813
01:09:53.490 --> 01:09:54.490
Is there something wrong?

814
01:09:54.761 --> 01:09:55.761
Don't you know?

815
01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:58.761
Did Hyuk plan that all by himself?

816
01:09:58.961 --> 01:10:00.631
What did he do?

817
01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:02.131
I don't understand.

818
01:10:02.801 --> 01:10:04.440
The planning team is in an uproar.

819
01:10:05.070 --> 01:10:06.101
Why?

820
01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:12.811
June.

821
01:10:24.091 --> 01:10:25.091
Mr. Kim?

822
01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:30.961
Hyuk brought him to the planning team.

823
01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:38.101
He says he wants to change the company.

824
01:10:38.971 --> 01:10:41.711
Don't you know what he's thinking?

825
01:10:42.141 --> 01:10:43.171
I don't know.

826
01:10:44.110 --> 01:10:45.811
He probably doesn't know what he's doing right now.

827
01:10:51.450 --> 01:10:52.520
I, Byun Hyuk,

828
01:10:53.820 --> 01:10:55.851
will revolutionize everything like my name.

829
01:10:57.251 --> 01:10:58.421
I'm getting...

830
01:10:58.721 --> 01:11:00.990
one step closer to you, June.
