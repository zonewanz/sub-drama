1
00:00:17.152 --> 00:00:18.891
But the person I saw in the window...

2
00:00:18.891 --> 00:00:19.961
(Episode 9)

3
00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:21.722
was you, Oh Man Soo.

4
00:00:23.691 --> 00:00:25.961
Leo, it's time. Come out.

5
00:00:38.172 --> 00:00:40.042
What on earth did I do?

6
00:00:40.612 --> 00:00:41.811
What should I do?

7
00:00:45.951 --> 00:00:47.121
Ms. Fortune-teller.

8
00:00:47.121 --> 00:00:49.082
Where's Tiffany? Where is she now?

9
00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:51.521
She's not home. She's not picking up her phone either.

10
00:00:52.892 --> 00:00:54.691
I... I must've done it.

11
00:00:55.322 --> 00:00:57.261
I don't remember anything because I was too drunk,

12
00:00:57.261 --> 00:00:58.561
but it must've been me.

13
00:00:59.561 --> 00:01:01.201
- I did it. - You should find her...

14
00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:03.631
and beg her for forgiveness before it's too late.

15
00:01:03.631 --> 00:01:05.101
That's why I came here.

16
00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:08.002
Where do you think she'd be now?

17
00:01:08.241 --> 00:01:09.702
What if it's already too late?

18
00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:11.071
Gosh.

19
00:01:12.541 --> 00:01:13.681
It was...

20
00:01:15.112 --> 00:01:17.711
somewhere you can see the entire city of Seoul.

21
00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:21.881
A Ferris wheel... I remember seeing a Ferris wheel.

22
00:01:22.351 --> 00:01:25.351
Where you can see the entire city of Seoul and a Ferris wheel...

23
00:01:26.661 --> 00:01:29.161
I think it's Royeol World.

24
00:01:29.321 --> 00:01:32.131
You can see the entire city from the fortress walls behind it.

25
00:01:32.131 --> 00:01:33.301
Get in.

26
00:01:41.972 --> 00:01:43.172
No!

27
00:01:49.512 --> 00:01:51.381
I wronged you. I'm sorry.

28
00:01:52.482 --> 00:01:53.922
I did it. It was me.

29
00:01:54.122 --> 00:01:55.482
I'll turn myself in.

30
00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:57.092
I'll correct everything.

31
00:02:04.732 --> 00:02:05.791
No, it wasn't you.

32
00:02:07.901 --> 00:02:11.072
I wounded that jerk's neck that day,

33
00:02:13.672 --> 00:02:15.172
but it was on the right side.

34
00:02:17.012 --> 00:02:19.142
I scratched his neck with the ring on my left hand,

35
00:02:19.841 --> 00:02:21.482
so it must've been the right side.

36
00:02:21.811 --> 00:02:23.551
The scar on your neck is on the left side.

37
00:02:23.982 --> 00:02:25.711
It wasn't you, Man Soo.

38
00:02:26.551 --> 00:02:29.621
The scar on Mr. Oh's neck...

39
00:02:30.121 --> 00:02:33.362
was from the debris of the building when it exploded.

40
00:02:37.632 --> 00:02:39.132
When you were being taken to the hospital,

41
00:02:39.132 --> 00:02:41.401
I saw the scrape on the left side of your neck.

42
00:02:44.371 --> 00:02:45.572
That jerk...

43
00:02:46.602 --> 00:02:48.271
That jerk lied to me.

44
00:03:00.382 --> 00:03:01.452
What?

45
00:03:09.292 --> 00:03:11.031
Please take care of Hyo Jin and Tiffany.

46
00:03:14.132 --> 00:03:15.662
The culprit was someone else.

47
00:03:16.401 --> 00:03:17.702
Who is that jerk?

48
00:03:19.471 --> 00:03:22.572
Right. Why did the youngest son of the Royeol family visit you?

49
00:03:23.512 --> 00:03:24.711
What did he say?

50
00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:29.311
I don't want you to meet a guy who's being accused of sexual assault.

51
00:03:29.912 --> 00:03:31.811
What did he say? It wasn't anything serious, right?

52
00:03:32.251 --> 00:03:34.281
- I'm tired. - All right.

53
00:03:50.602 --> 00:03:52.031
Hey, Leo!

54
00:03:54.371 --> 00:03:55.501
What is this?

55
00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:05.711
I think Oh Man Soo came to talk to him after knowing that he did it.

56
00:04:07.021 --> 00:04:08.151
I can't just leave this.

57
00:04:10.991 --> 00:04:13.792
Hello, sir. It looks like Leo got himself into trouble.

58
00:04:17.492 --> 00:04:18.492
(Statement)

59
00:04:19.361 --> 00:04:20.502
(Witness Statement)

60
00:04:22.961 --> 00:04:24.802
(Oh Man Soo went upstairs after asking me to tell Tiffany,)

61
00:04:24.802 --> 00:04:26.601
(and I passed the message along to her.)

62
00:04:27.942 --> 00:04:29.802
That jerk, Son Byung Ho, lied.

63
00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:35.611
Detective Han.

64
00:04:38.351 --> 00:04:40.822
Those two humans died because of you.

65
00:04:42.221 --> 00:04:44.921
Go to the police right now, and tell them everything, you punk.

66
00:04:45.091 --> 00:04:47.392
I must at least free them from their injustice.

67
00:04:53.401 --> 00:04:54.802
Who is that human?

68
00:04:57.802 --> 00:04:58.802
What is this?

69
00:04:59.702 --> 00:05:01.101
Will this punk die too?

70
00:05:01.101 --> 00:05:02.271
(Seoun Police Station)

71
00:05:13.622 --> 00:05:15.052
What happened?

72
00:05:15.351 --> 00:05:16.692
Did you save their lives?

73
00:05:16.752 --> 00:05:18.252
I have a favor to ask of you, Joon.

74
00:05:18.492 --> 00:05:20.892
Let me out. Let me get out of here.

75
00:05:20.892 --> 00:05:22.322
What on earth is this about?

76
00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:24.961
You brought me here for another statement. What are you doing now?

77
00:05:24.961 --> 00:05:26.492
I'm really sorry.

78
00:05:26.932 --> 00:05:29.802
Please stay in there for just a while. It's the safest place now.

79
00:05:31.531 --> 00:05:33.572
Gosh, what is this nonsense about?

80
00:05:34.401 --> 00:05:35.401
What happened?

81
00:05:36.541 --> 00:05:38.012
What happened to that woman?

82
00:05:39.012 --> 00:05:40.512
We have a big problem, Joon.

83
00:05:40.512 --> 00:05:43.182
Mr. Oh will get killed.

84
00:05:43.911 --> 00:05:44.911
He'll get killed?

85
00:05:47.052 --> 00:05:49.052
Hey, Son Byung Ho! I know that you're home now.

86
00:05:49.582 --> 00:05:51.221
Come out right now. Come out!

87
00:05:57.461 --> 00:05:59.161
You jerk, why didn't you pick up? Where are you now?

88
00:05:59.161 --> 00:06:00.762
Why did you lie to me, you jerk?

89
00:06:00.762 --> 00:06:02.632
You know who did that to Tiffany, don't you?

90
00:06:02.632 --> 00:06:04.731
Who is it? Tell me who it is!

91
00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:07.271
Well, Man Soo, please calm down first.

92
00:06:07.271 --> 00:06:08.671
- Hear me out... - Calm down?

93
00:06:09.671 --> 00:06:10.812
You want me to calm down?

94
00:06:12.072 --> 00:06:14.882
Let's meet somewhere quiet. Right, I'll see you at your cottage.

95
00:06:20.552 --> 00:06:21.882
He'll get killed?

96
00:06:22.822 --> 00:06:24.122
But it'll be...

97
00:06:24.752 --> 00:06:26.452
staged as suicide.

98
00:06:29.721 --> 00:06:31.562
I think that the jerk who did that to Tiffany...

99
00:06:32.161 --> 00:06:34.132
is trying to kill Mr. Oh and stage it as suicide...

100
00:06:34.132 --> 00:06:36.231
to make him take the blame for everything.

101
00:06:36.231 --> 00:06:37.231
But that jerk...

102
00:06:39.531 --> 00:06:41.171
doesn't have a middle finger.

103
00:06:41.671 --> 00:06:43.271
He doesn't have a middle finger?

104
00:06:43.671 --> 00:06:46.882
At first, I thought that it was bitten off by Sip Gyeon,

105
00:06:47.411 --> 00:06:50.552
but I remembered that there wasn't a single drop of blood.

106
00:06:51.882 --> 00:06:53.921
It must've been a prosthetic finger.

107
00:06:53.921 --> 00:06:56.651
He doesn't have a middle finger? Could he be...

108
00:06:57.392 --> 00:06:59.091
the man who killed Han Jin Sook?

109
00:07:11.101 --> 00:07:12.771
You're saying that you want me to stage it as suicide, right?

110
00:07:13.341 --> 00:07:15.671
Anyway, we'll be able to save Mr. Oh's life and catch that jerk,

111
00:07:15.841 --> 00:07:19.211
who assaulted Tiffany, if we track down the guy with a missing finger.

112
00:07:25.382 --> 00:07:26.981
Then why is she supposed to die?

113
00:07:28.552 --> 00:07:29.582
Why?

114
00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:33.461
She'll take her own life.

115
00:07:33.591 --> 00:07:35.961
She won't jump this time. She'll slit her wrist.

116
00:07:36.461 --> 00:07:37.461
You mean she'll kill herself?

117
00:07:38.531 --> 00:07:40.161
I don't understand what's going on.

118
00:07:40.161 --> 00:07:41.802
You said that your boss...

119
00:07:41.802 --> 00:07:44.401
will get framed and die, but it'll be staged as suicide.

120
00:07:44.401 --> 00:07:47.541
Then the misunderstanding will be cleared. Why would she kill herself?

121
00:07:48.202 --> 00:07:49.442
I think that it's strange too.

122
00:07:49.841 --> 00:07:52.012
I can't understand it no matter how hard I think about it.

123
00:07:58.851 --> 00:07:59.851
What?

124
00:08:01.752 --> 00:08:03.851
Hey, Moo Gang. Hey.

125
00:08:04.291 --> 00:08:05.692
- Oh, hello. - Hello.

126
00:08:05.692 --> 00:08:07.622
Come here. Hey.

127
00:08:08.692 --> 00:08:10.591
Why is that woman here?

128
00:08:10.932 --> 00:08:13.932
She's that gold digger, isn't she?

129
00:08:15.101 --> 00:08:18.771
Come on. Why did you lock her up in there? It isn't even our case.

130
00:08:18.932 --> 00:08:19.971
What will you do if someone sees her?

131
00:08:26.242 --> 00:08:29.281
We're certain that Han Jin Sook was killed by Woo Byung Sik, right?

132
00:08:29.582 --> 00:08:33.582
Yes. Well, that's how the higher-ups want us to close the case.

133
00:08:33.881 --> 00:08:36.182
Gwang Gyun went berserk,

134
00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:37.391
but he has no power, you know.

135
00:08:37.552 --> 00:08:39.991
Anyway, I'm writing the case closure report now.

136
00:08:40.091 --> 00:08:43.062
The killer is this man wearing a watch with a butterfly design...

137
00:08:43.192 --> 00:08:46.162
In other words, Woo Byung Sik's henchman. Right?

138
00:08:46.261 --> 00:08:47.902
Well... Yes.

139
00:08:48.461 --> 00:08:49.501
But why do you ask?

140
00:08:49.501 --> 00:08:50.871
If Woo Byung Sik is dead,

141
00:08:50.871 --> 00:08:54.172
this punk must be on the run or laying low.

142
00:08:54.302 --> 00:08:56.341
If he really is the man without a finger,

143
00:08:56.611 --> 00:08:58.971
why would he kill that girl's boss?

144
00:08:59.511 --> 00:09:02.241
But if this man wasn't Woo Byung Sik...

145
00:09:02.912 --> 00:09:04.912
Excuse me. Please let me out.

146
00:09:05.052 --> 00:09:07.182
My daughter... She needs her medication now.

147
00:09:07.322 --> 00:09:10.922
- What... Medication? - She has a respiratory condition.

148
00:09:13.391 --> 00:09:14.562
What kind of medicine do you need?

149
00:09:14.961 --> 00:09:17.932
I left the house determined to kill myself. Of course I didn't bring it.

150
00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:21.231
Let me out now! Please let me go.

151
00:09:21.832 --> 00:09:25.131
I must go home and give her the medication now. Please?

152
00:09:25.631 --> 00:09:26.641
Home?

153
00:09:29.001 --> 00:09:30.211
I must not let her go home.

154
00:09:31.172 --> 00:09:33.412
I'll go to a pharmacy now and pick it up for you.

155
00:09:33.582 --> 00:09:36.442
You can't. You need a prescription to buy it.

156
00:09:36.442 --> 00:09:38.251
Let me out, please.

157
00:09:40.721 --> 00:09:43.552
Then I'll go to your place and bring it. Where is it?

158
00:10:01.141 --> 00:10:03.442
What's going on? Why isn't the light turning on?

159
00:10:17.621 --> 00:10:18.891
The top drawer...

160
00:10:21.761 --> 00:10:23.091
Hey, Byung Ho. Where are you now?

161
00:10:23.391 --> 00:10:26.562
I'm sorry, Man Soo. I was only following orders.

162
00:10:27.501 --> 00:10:30.001
Hello? Hello? Hey, hey!

163
00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:32.402
That jerk...

164
00:11:47.542 --> 00:11:49.182
I caught the bar girl.

165
00:11:50.452 --> 00:11:51.652
Yes, she's alone.

166
00:11:53.351 --> 00:11:54.351
Shall I take care of her?

167
00:11:55.981 --> 00:11:56.991
Yes, sir.

168
00:12:33.891 --> 00:12:35.292
It's over.

169
00:12:57.611 --> 00:12:59.751
Gosh, it's hot! No!

170
00:12:59.751 --> 00:13:01.052
Darn it. Gosh!

171
00:13:01.282 --> 00:13:02.282
You little...

172
00:13:52.902 --> 00:13:53.971
Let go. Gosh.

173
00:14:00.782 --> 00:14:01.782
What?

174
00:14:02.542 --> 00:14:03.682
You're not that jerk.

175
00:14:06.351 --> 00:14:07.621
A sausage?

176
00:14:08.851 --> 00:14:10.422
Did she think that was a finger?

177
00:14:15.792 --> 00:14:17.361
- What... What's happening? - Help...

178
00:14:18.932 --> 00:14:20.101
- Help me... - You didn't die?

179
00:14:21.231 --> 00:14:22.832
Help... Help...

180
00:14:24.231 --> 00:14:25.371
Help me.

181
00:14:27.641 --> 00:14:30.471
Darn it. Why are those punks there?

182
00:14:50.562 --> 00:14:52.361
Ha Ram. Gosh, Ha Ram.

183
00:14:52.861 --> 00:14:54.402
Ha Ram. My gosh!

184
00:14:54.402 --> 00:14:55.461
Ha Ram. Gosh.

185
00:14:55.461 --> 00:14:58.131
Joon, you should go find my boss.

186
00:14:58.332 --> 00:15:01.202
Catch whoever it is that is trying to kill him, okay?

187
00:15:01.702 --> 00:15:04.412
"My boss"? Since when did you call him like that?

188
00:15:07.082 --> 00:15:08.082
All right.

189
00:15:09.141 --> 00:15:11.912
I'll head over to his cottage as soon as I bring the medication.

190
00:15:12.381 --> 00:15:15.381
Excuse me. Gosh, please let me out.

191
00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:16.381
Hyo Jin.

192
00:15:17.121 --> 00:15:20.062
- Mom. - What should I do? Hyo Jin...

193
00:15:20.391 --> 00:15:23.062
Excuse me. Detective, please let us out.

194
00:15:23.062 --> 00:15:25.332
- Mom. - Please let us go!

195
00:15:25.461 --> 00:15:27.361
Ha Ram, are you okay? Gosh, Ha Ram...

196
00:15:27.361 --> 00:15:28.902
Are you all right? Gosh.

197
00:15:33.641 --> 00:15:36.001
- Mom! - You jerk!

198
00:15:37.111 --> 00:15:39.312
Gosh, Hyo Jin. Are you okay, Hyo Jin?

199
00:15:41.042 --> 00:15:42.042
Gosh, that jerk.

200
00:15:46.582 --> 00:15:47.851
I'm glad the shadow is gone.

201
00:15:59.532 --> 00:16:00.532
Hold on.

202
00:16:00.961 --> 00:16:02.761
Would they think I saved his life?

203
00:16:03.802 --> 00:16:06.641
No way. He hung on to me.

204
00:16:06.641 --> 00:16:08.371
I did my best to shake him off.

205
00:16:08.802 --> 00:16:10.542
Yes, the rope broke.

206
00:16:10.542 --> 00:16:13.312
The rope saved him, not me.

207
00:16:13.582 --> 00:16:16.241
I have nothing to do with his survival.

208
00:16:18.652 --> 00:16:20.481
I'll go to the villa right away.

209
00:17:11.832 --> 00:17:13.502
Kim Sun Young!

210
00:17:19.042 --> 00:17:20.312
You'd better hide yourself well.

211
00:18:07.562 --> 00:18:09.891
- Excuse me. - Let go of me. Let go!

212
00:18:12.191 --> 00:18:14.732
You crazy jerk. How dare you hit her?

213
00:18:14.832 --> 00:18:17.101
- Stop! What are you doing? - How dare you?

214
00:18:17.572 --> 00:18:19.832
- Stop. Go now! - Let go of me.

215
00:18:19.832 --> 00:18:22.671
- Hey! Stop right there! - I'm fine!

216
00:18:22.671 --> 00:18:24.671
Stop it!

217
00:18:24.671 --> 00:18:25.972
Officer Na.

218
00:18:29.812 --> 00:18:32.151
Stop it. I'm fine.

219
00:18:32.512 --> 00:18:34.151
This happens every day.

220
00:18:34.881 --> 00:18:35.951
You're a police officer.

221
00:18:36.351 --> 00:18:39.022
You shouldn't hit others because of someone like me.

222
00:18:49.631 --> 00:18:50.701
Your face...

223
00:19:00.082 --> 00:19:02.411
You're so handsome, darling.

224
00:19:05.212 --> 00:19:06.212
Here you go.

225
00:19:06.722 --> 00:19:07.722
Okay.

226
00:19:09.052 --> 00:19:10.052
Oh, that's right.

227
00:19:10.391 --> 00:19:12.552
I heard the new commissioner general is a woman.

228
00:19:12.552 --> 00:19:14.391
She's making a fuss about shutting down the bars here...

229
00:19:14.391 --> 00:19:16.161
to crack down on prostitution.

230
00:19:16.161 --> 00:19:17.992
Those girls have nothing but their bodies.

231
00:19:17.992 --> 00:19:19.931
What's so wrong about them selling themselves?

232
00:19:20.562 --> 00:19:21.901
- Am I right? - It is wrong.

233
00:19:23.671 --> 00:19:25.802
You can't pay someone for sexual favors.

234
00:19:25.802 --> 00:19:28.272
You should quit your job too.

235
00:19:29.441 --> 00:19:32.671
Do you think I want to do this?

236
00:19:33.341 --> 00:19:36.851
I have a load of debts, so I can't quit even if I want to.

237
00:19:36.851 --> 00:19:38.052
And what if I did?

238
00:19:38.752 --> 00:19:39.812
How should I make a living?

239
00:19:44.651 --> 00:19:46.992
With this money, you can pay off your debts...

240
00:19:47.722 --> 00:19:50.391
and get a house in Seoul even if it may be small.

241
00:19:52.262 --> 00:19:53.401
Officer Na.

242
00:19:56.062 --> 00:19:57.802
I will make you happy, Clara.

243
00:20:04.542 --> 00:20:05.542
What a fool.

244
00:20:07.482 --> 00:20:11.151
If you ran away with my money, you should be living a nice life.

245
00:20:11.151 --> 00:20:13.722
Why did you come back like this?

246
00:20:14.022 --> 00:20:15.022
Why?

247
00:20:19.492 --> 00:20:21.222
What kind of a scum did this to you?

248
00:20:29.131 --> 00:20:30.131
What?

249
00:20:30.532 --> 00:20:32.201
Her shadow is gone?

250
00:20:39.042 --> 00:20:41.881
So this is why humans often say, "It's driving me crazy."

251
00:20:44.312 --> 00:20:45.312
I got it.

252
00:20:47.451 --> 00:20:48.482
My house?

253
00:20:49.522 --> 00:20:52.322
Yes. The police told us to stay somewhere safe,

254
00:20:52.322 --> 00:20:54.522
but my house is on the rooftop. It's not very safe.

255
00:20:54.861 --> 00:20:57.631
I thought your house would be safer. Please understand.

256
00:20:59.391 --> 00:21:00.502
Fine.

257
00:21:02.861 --> 00:21:03.871
The password?

258
00:21:05.431 --> 00:21:07.472
It's 4444.

259
00:21:08.941 --> 00:21:11.472
Four fours. I'm hanging up now.

260
00:21:12.972 --> 00:21:15.881
Do you remember anything else about that jerk?

261
00:21:15.982 --> 00:21:17.712
Even just a little thing would be good.

262
00:21:18.482 --> 00:21:19.552
I'm not sure.

263
00:21:20.351 --> 00:21:23.151
He somehow stank a bit.

264
00:21:23.151 --> 00:21:24.651
He stank?

265
00:21:24.651 --> 00:21:26.091
It was a sickening smell.

266
00:21:27.292 --> 00:21:29.322
It was like the smell of rubber.

267
00:21:30.062 --> 00:21:31.492
The smell of rubber?

268
00:21:34.232 --> 00:21:35.232
Was it...

269
00:21:36.002 --> 00:21:38.401
the smell of mugwort by any chance?

270
00:21:38.401 --> 00:21:40.441
The stink of mugwort.

271
00:21:41.242 --> 00:21:42.542
Come to think of it,

272
00:21:43.042 --> 00:21:44.641
it did smell like mugwort.

273
00:21:46.141 --> 00:21:47.181
That's right.

274
00:21:47.582 --> 00:21:49.181
That bathroom.

275
00:21:55.951 --> 00:21:57.292
It's that smell.

276
00:21:58.891 --> 00:22:00.361
The smell of burning mugwort.

277
00:22:00.822 --> 00:22:02.421
It also smelled like rubber.

278
00:22:02.421 --> 00:22:05.562
I got it. I think I know who that jerk was.

279
00:22:05.962 --> 00:22:07.562
I can't believe you did this again!

280
00:22:07.562 --> 00:22:09.262
When you passed out at the hotel before,

281
00:22:09.262 --> 00:22:11.901
you promised me you'd never do drugs again.

282
00:22:11.901 --> 00:22:14.401
It has been only a month, and you caused trouble again.

283
00:22:14.401 --> 00:22:15.772
I didn't do it.

284
00:22:15.772 --> 00:22:18.441
You'd better stay here and lie low.

285
00:22:20.341 --> 00:22:23.411
Doctor, please keep this a secret like the last time.

286
00:22:23.411 --> 00:22:24.712
Okay.

287
00:22:24.782 --> 00:22:26.782
I'm doing this as a special favor to someone as well.

288
00:22:26.782 --> 00:22:29.552
- Please take good care of him. - Sure.

289
00:22:30.351 --> 00:22:31.421
All right.

290
00:22:31.591 --> 00:22:33.792
Hello? Yes, I'm on my way out now.

291
00:22:43.871 --> 00:22:45.232
Bodyguard... Bodyguard!

292
00:22:45.232 --> 00:22:48.371
There are no bodyguards, you brat. I caught you, you jerk.

293
00:22:59.812 --> 00:23:01.822
I think I get it now.

294
00:23:02.681 --> 00:23:05.591
Your dad must have hidden you here, right?

295
00:23:05.591 --> 00:23:07.191
He hid you here...

296
00:23:07.191 --> 00:23:09.292
to lay all the blame on your uncle.

297
00:23:09.292 --> 00:23:11.891
No... No. I don't know anything.

298
00:23:11.891 --> 00:23:12.992
I... I don't know.

299
00:23:12.992 --> 00:23:14.562
You don't know? You little...

300
00:23:14.562 --> 00:23:17.272
You'd better tell me the truth before I chop off your tongue...

301
00:23:17.272 --> 00:23:18.832
and chomp on it, okay?

302
00:23:18.832 --> 00:23:21.272
- I really don't know anything. - Of course you'd say that.

303
00:23:21.272 --> 00:23:25.042
Let's go to the police and see if you really don't know, okay?

304
00:23:25.111 --> 00:23:26.911
You should have a drug test first.

305
00:23:27.641 --> 00:23:30.351
Please. Please let it slide just this once. Please?

306
00:23:31.712 --> 00:23:34.151
How dare you do drugs when you're still wet behind the ears?

307
00:23:34.151 --> 00:23:36.282
Come here. Come here, you brat.

308
00:23:40.762 --> 00:23:42.222
Mister.

309
00:23:45.191 --> 00:23:46.962
Why are you alone? Where is Ha Ram?

310
00:23:46.962 --> 00:23:49.302
She and my mom went outside.

311
00:23:51.101 --> 00:23:53.742
Where did she go this time? Gosh.

312
00:23:56.572 --> 00:23:58.441
What? Give that to me.

313
00:23:58.441 --> 00:23:59.611
No.

314
00:24:00.111 --> 00:24:02.082
- Give it to me. It's not a toy. - No.

315
00:24:02.482 --> 00:24:03.911
It's not a toy.

316
00:24:03.911 --> 00:24:08.082
Give it back. Give it back to me.

317
00:24:08.082 --> 00:24:10.252
- Give it back. - What?

318
00:24:10.252 --> 00:24:11.951
What did you do with the thing inside?

319
00:24:11.951 --> 00:24:13.992
Nothing was inside.

320
00:24:13.992 --> 00:24:15.861
- Was there really nothing inside? - Yes.

321
00:24:15.861 --> 00:24:18.861
Wasn't there an empty, transparent capsule...

322
00:24:18.861 --> 00:24:20.861
which looks like a toy capsule?

323
00:24:20.861 --> 00:24:23.232
I told you that there was nothing inside.

324
00:24:23.232 --> 00:24:25.431
Darn it. Where did it go?

325
00:24:35.841 --> 00:24:37.651
Ha Ram. Where are you?

326
00:24:37.651 --> 00:24:39.351
Why didn't you call me sooner?

327
00:24:39.782 --> 00:24:41.582
I'm in Mr. Oh's dad's hospital room.

328
00:24:41.582 --> 00:24:43.022
I caught the jerk who assaulted Tiffany.

329
00:24:43.451 --> 00:24:44.921
I cannot believe this.

330
00:24:48.591 --> 00:24:49.591
Hello?

331
00:24:50.332 --> 00:24:51.332
Hello?

332
00:24:52.232 --> 00:24:53.232
Ha Ram!

333
00:24:55.131 --> 00:24:56.131
What's going on?

334
00:25:02.002 --> 00:25:03.042
(Loser)

335
00:25:12.111 --> 00:25:13.111
This woman...

336
00:25:14.151 --> 00:25:15.951
knows that I'm the one who did it.

337
00:25:17.552 --> 00:25:19.091
What should I do, Dad?

338
00:25:20.621 --> 00:25:23.792
Hide the girl in the trunk quietly without anyone noticing,

339
00:25:23.792 --> 00:25:25.391
and stay right there.

340
00:25:25.391 --> 00:25:26.901
I'll send someone right away.

341
00:25:28.332 --> 00:25:30.201
How could you mess this up?

342
00:25:30.201 --> 00:25:32.171
You can't even handle a bar hostess?

343
00:25:32.171 --> 00:25:34.272
You made things much worse!

344
00:25:34.841 --> 00:25:35.841
I'm sorry.

345
00:25:36.812 --> 00:25:38.871
The car owner. You bought his tongue, right?

346
00:25:38.871 --> 00:25:39.881
Yes.

347
00:25:39.881 --> 00:25:41.042
Security cameras.

348
00:25:41.381 --> 00:25:43.752
Tell the hospital security team to delete the footage! Now!

349
00:25:46.252 --> 00:25:47.252
Delete the footage?

350
00:25:48.421 --> 00:25:50.891
But a detective just checked it already.

351
00:25:52.351 --> 00:25:54.191
6723... 6723.

352
00:25:59.631 --> 00:26:00.701
What is this?

353
00:26:00.962 --> 00:26:01.962
Why isn't it working?

354
00:26:06.742 --> 00:26:09.302
Why can't I teleport again? Why does it have to happen now?

355
00:26:23.154 --> 00:26:26.194
But how did she know it was me?

356
00:27:57.825 --> 00:27:59.755
- Come here. - Hey.

357
00:28:01.424 --> 00:28:03.765
Why didn't you come out of there today?

358
00:28:03.765 --> 00:28:05.464
You're not constipated anymore?

359
00:28:06.464 --> 00:28:08.664
I must find it. 16N6723.

360
00:28:08.995 --> 00:28:10.904
- Hurry. - Get off me, you punk!

361
00:28:11.164 --> 00:28:13.505
Do you think I'm your minion?

362
00:28:13.505 --> 00:28:14.735
Am I your servant?

363
00:28:15.075 --> 00:28:16.775
Find it yourself.

364
00:28:17.204 --> 00:28:19.805
I'm busy peeing.

365
00:28:23.545 --> 00:28:24.785
Please.

366
00:28:28.684 --> 00:28:29.954
Help me, please.

367
00:28:32.384 --> 00:28:33.394
Hey.

368
00:28:33.725 --> 00:28:35.854
He turned left at the main building of the hospital?

369
00:28:35.854 --> 00:28:37.825
He probably crossed Seongju Bridge then.

370
00:28:37.825 --> 00:28:39.565
Check the security cameras there.

371
00:28:39.664 --> 00:28:41.434
I'm on it.

372
00:28:44.104 --> 00:28:45.204
Here. It's this car, right?

373
00:28:45.704 --> 00:28:46.704
It is.

374
00:28:48.204 --> 00:28:49.335
Hello?

375
00:28:50.144 --> 00:28:51.745
I'm on my way now.

376
00:28:52.904 --> 00:28:54.045
Yes.

377
00:28:55.315 --> 00:28:56.315
Detective Kim.

378
00:28:57.585 --> 00:28:58.585
Detective Kim.

379
00:28:59.045 --> 00:29:00.055
- Excuse me. - What?

380
00:29:00.055 --> 00:29:01.454
- What's going on? - Let me use your car.

381
00:29:01.454 --> 00:29:03.154
Detective Han! Hey!

382
00:29:12.495 --> 00:29:14.495
Ha Ram, please stay alive.

383
00:29:15.065 --> 00:29:19.134
I will have a long life until I become an old lady.

384
00:29:20.535 --> 00:29:22.775
If she wants that, why would she meddle in everyone's business?

385
00:29:22.775 --> 00:29:24.404
Anyway, you must stay alive.

386
00:29:24.404 --> 00:29:27.714
If you die now, no grim reapers can come to take you!

387

<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

388
00:30:08.515 --> 00:30:10.454
Where is she? Could it be...

389
00:30:28.835 --> 00:30:30.075
Somebody!

390
00:30:30.644 --> 00:30:32.144
Help!

391
00:30:41.515 --> 00:30:43.114
Help me!

392
00:30:44.585 --> 00:30:46.924
Help me, please!

393
00:30:47.954 --> 00:30:49.225
Why is she in there?

394
00:30:49.225 --> 00:30:50.565
Help!

395
00:30:50.995 --> 00:30:52.964
- Help! - That idiot.

396
00:30:55.364 --> 00:30:57.634
All right. Okay.

397
00:31:04.644 --> 00:31:05.975
Stop the car, you punk!

398
00:31:05.975 --> 00:31:07.275
Would you?

399
00:31:07.275 --> 00:31:08.545
Stop the car!

400
00:31:28.194 --> 00:31:30.404
Where have you been? Captain Bong looked all over for you.

401
00:31:30.404 --> 00:31:32.164
Where is the report on the skeleton?

402
00:31:32.164 --> 00:31:33.475
- Why? - Give me a second.

403
00:31:34.335 --> 00:31:35.874
- Where is it? - Here.

404
00:31:41.075 --> 00:31:43.444
What? Is this all?

405
00:31:43.845 --> 00:31:44.845
What do you mean?

406
00:31:46.914 --> 00:31:47.914
"What do you mean?"

407
00:31:51.555 --> 00:31:55.225
You idiot. Do you think this is a proper report?

408
00:31:55.225 --> 00:31:56.325
Are you discriminating people?

409
00:31:56.325 --> 00:31:59.265
You do everything you can for Woo Byung Sik and Han Jin Sook's case.

410
00:31:59.394 --> 00:32:02.634
Do you think this is an abandoned skeleton of nobody? Is that it?

411
00:32:03.164 --> 00:32:04.904
Don't consider yourselves detectives.

412
00:32:06.364 --> 00:32:08.305
I'm not even in charge of that case.

413
00:32:08.305 --> 00:32:10.204
- It was Moo Gang's. - Shut it.

414
00:32:13.815 --> 00:32:15.045
Hi, it's me.

415
00:32:15.045 --> 00:32:17.485
Do you remember the skeleton we found in the mountain?

416
00:32:18.045 --> 00:32:19.614
The one Moo Gang threw up on.

417
00:32:20.384 --> 00:32:22.684
Yes. Could you...

418
00:32:23.255 --> 00:32:26.184
run tests on the skeleton again and do it thoroughly?

419
00:32:26.525 --> 00:32:28.095
Please do this for me.

420
00:32:28.595 --> 00:32:30.424
Yes, call me if you find anything.

421
00:32:31.265 --> 00:32:32.325
Okay.

422
00:32:37.735 --> 00:32:40.674
Darn it. Why did Moo Gang hide it?

423
00:33:08.864 --> 00:33:09.864
No.

424
00:33:20.314 --> 00:33:23.044
Ha Ram. Ha Ram.

425
00:33:24.415 --> 00:33:26.114
Ha Ram. Ha Ram?

426
00:33:27.055 --> 00:33:28.055
Wake up.

427
00:33:28.384 --> 00:33:29.455
Wake up!

428
00:33:30.254 --> 00:33:31.254
Ha Ram.

429
00:33:34.555 --> 00:33:37.125
I decided that I would never die.

430
00:33:39.024 --> 00:33:40.435
I decided to survive...

431
00:33:41.634 --> 00:33:43.265
no matter what happens.

432
00:34:08.895 --> 00:34:10.864
All right. You're okay, right?

433
00:34:28.944 --> 00:34:30.685
No. No.

434
00:34:30.845 --> 00:34:32.685
Joon. Joon.

435
00:34:32.814 --> 00:34:34.114
Wake up.

436
00:34:34.754 --> 00:34:35.855
No, Joon.

437
00:34:35.915 --> 00:34:37.185
How dare you!

438
00:34:40.825 --> 00:34:41.825
I'm glad...

439
00:34:43.024 --> 00:34:44.165
you're alive.

440
00:34:45.294 --> 00:34:48.395
Joon. Joon, wake up.

441
00:34:48.395 --> 00:34:50.765
- My gosh, she's so loud. - Joon. No.

442
00:34:50.765 --> 00:34:53.404
- Please wake up. - She's so annoying.

443
00:34:53.404 --> 00:34:54.935
Ha Ram.

444
00:34:54.935 --> 00:34:55.935
Joon.

445
00:34:59.345 --> 00:35:01.174
You're nothing. How dare you?

446
00:35:01.214 --> 00:35:02.745
Do you even know who I am?

447
00:35:03.444 --> 00:35:04.745
I'm going to kill you!

448
00:35:04.745 --> 00:35:07.114
No! No!

449
00:35:10.625 --> 00:35:11.924
You better keep this in mind.

450
00:35:12.384 --> 00:35:15.424
Don't lock eyesight with a human that's fallen in love.

451
00:35:17.325 --> 00:35:18.665
If you do,

452
00:35:18.665 --> 00:35:21.694
something tragic will happen to you.

453
00:35:31.444 --> 00:35:33.314
Please wake up, Joon.

454
00:35:33.314 --> 00:35:36.444
Don't die. Please don't die.

455
00:35:45.455 --> 00:35:48.395
Oh Man Soo of Royeol Insurance was known to be the culprit...

456
00:35:48.395 --> 00:35:50.625
of the recent rape attempt. However, it turns out...

457
00:35:50.625 --> 00:35:52.995
that the real culprit was Royeol Group's eldest son,

458
00:35:52.995 --> 00:35:55.194
Oh Sang Min.

459
00:35:55.294 --> 00:35:56.765
He abducted a civilian,

460
00:35:56.765 --> 00:35:59.064
and he stole a car to escape from the police.

461
00:35:59.064 --> 00:36:01.404
However, he got caught by Detective Han Moo Gang...

462
00:36:01.404 --> 00:36:03.274
of Seoun Police Station's homicide department.

463
00:36:03.274 --> 00:36:05.745
In that process, the abducted civilian...

464
00:36:05.745 --> 00:36:09.475
and Detective Han both got injured and were transferred to a hospital.

465
00:36:09.475 --> 00:36:12.785
Thankfully, their injuries were not that severe.

466
00:36:12.785 --> 00:36:14.884
- Moo Gang. - The motive behind...

467
00:36:14.884 --> 00:36:16.524
- You were alive? - Oh Sang Min's...

468
00:36:16.524 --> 00:36:18.484
criminal act is yet unknown.

469
00:36:18.484 --> 00:36:20.995
Since the culprit wasn't severely injured...

470
00:36:20.995 --> 00:36:22.794
and has been arrested on the spot,

471
00:36:22.794 --> 00:36:25.595
the police stated that they'll start investigating right away.

472
00:36:26.834 --> 00:36:29.035
The phone is turned off.

473
00:36:29.035 --> 00:36:31.904
Please leave a message after the tone. After you're connected...

474
00:36:37.605 --> 00:36:39.745
Please connect me to Seoun Police Station's homicide department.

475
00:36:40.915 --> 00:36:42.145
Hello?

476
00:36:42.145 --> 00:36:43.915
Is Detective Han there?

477
00:36:45.515 --> 00:36:47.154
He's not in the office right now.

478
00:36:49.484 --> 00:36:50.484
I...

479
00:36:52.785 --> 00:36:55.895
I was kidnapped, but I just escaped.

480
00:36:56.194 --> 00:36:59.265
Yes, okay. We'll go there right away.

481
00:37:07.205 --> 00:37:08.375
Hey, it's me.

482
00:37:09.475 --> 00:37:11.605
I know where Yoon Soo Wan is.

483
00:37:25.555 --> 00:37:26.654
Hey, over here...

484
00:37:30.825 --> 00:37:32.794
How dare you try to escape?

485
00:37:36.165 --> 00:37:40.334
The culprit of the attempted rape case turned out to be...

486
00:37:40.334 --> 00:37:42.535
the only son of Royeol Group's CEO Oh Man Ho,

487
00:37:42.535 --> 00:37:44.875
who is also the nephew of Oh Man Soo.

488
00:37:44.875 --> 00:37:47.444
I'm sorry, but I had every reason to be suspicious of you.

489
00:37:47.444 --> 00:37:49.114
I saw you coming out...

490
00:37:49.345 --> 00:37:51.444
from Oh Man Soo's room after the assault incident that day.

491
00:37:51.444 --> 00:37:54.955
But if you were in that room, you would've seen her get injured.

492
00:37:55.254 --> 00:37:56.254
Why didn't you say anything?

493
00:37:56.254 --> 00:37:58.725
Due to what happened, the campaign that was...

494
00:37:58.725 --> 00:38:00.424
- being organized by... - To be honest,

495
00:38:00.424 --> 00:38:03.464
I was secretly doing drugs in Man Soo's room because it was empty.

496
00:38:03.524 --> 00:38:05.964
So I didn't really know what was going on.

497
00:38:06.364 --> 00:38:08.134
You know what happens when I get high.

498
00:38:09.334 --> 00:38:12.435
My gosh, I can't believe this. What is wrong with you?

499
00:38:12.435 --> 00:38:13.904
Don't tell the CEO.

500
00:38:14.134 --> 00:38:16.705
I'll really quit this time, so please turn a blind eye.

501
00:38:16.705 --> 00:38:17.975
What... What?

502
00:38:22.845 --> 00:38:23.845
(Females and Juveniles Department)

503
00:38:23.845 --> 00:38:26.185
Then Let us begin.

504
00:38:26.185 --> 00:38:28.814
Can you tell me what happened at the party?

505
00:38:28.814 --> 00:38:31.424
I can't remember because I was drunk.

506
00:38:31.424 --> 00:38:33.754
He can't remember.

507
00:38:34.325 --> 00:38:35.694
Then you could've just said...

508
00:38:35.694 --> 00:38:39.024
that you didn't remember anything in the first place.

509
00:38:39.024 --> 00:38:42.294
Why did you have to mess with a cop and make things so complicated?

510
00:38:42.294 --> 00:38:44.205
I didn't mean to do that to him.

511
00:38:44.864 --> 00:38:46.435
But he started attacking me first.

512
00:38:46.435 --> 00:38:48.475
It was self-defense.

513
00:38:48.475 --> 00:38:50.674
Then I guess this is self-defense.

514
00:38:52.475 --> 00:38:53.475
Have you ever...

515
00:38:54.245 --> 00:38:56.375
received any psychological treatment?

516
00:38:56.375 --> 00:38:57.444
Yes, he has.

517
00:38:59.084 --> 00:39:02.015
He had experienced shock because of his parents' divorce.

518
00:39:02.015 --> 00:39:05.084
I see. You've received psychological therapy for two years.

519
00:39:07.924 --> 00:39:08.995
What are you doing here?

520
00:39:11.064 --> 00:39:12.665
What a load of nonsense.

521
00:39:12.665 --> 00:39:14.535
Who are you? My gosh.

522
00:39:14.935 --> 00:39:15.995
"Mental illness"?

523
00:39:17.205 --> 00:39:19.535
How much money did you receive from Royeol Group?

524
00:39:19.665 --> 00:39:22.075
My gosh, you're an embarrassment.

525
00:39:22.205 --> 00:39:23.575
Who are you?

526
00:39:23.575 --> 00:39:25.904
Shall I get a few DNA samples now?

527
00:39:25.904 --> 00:39:27.944
Who do you think you are?

528
00:39:30.645 --> 00:39:32.714
- Seriously. - What are you doing?

529
00:39:32.714 --> 00:39:34.685
They already took his DNA sample.

530
00:39:38.024 --> 00:39:41.194
Mr. Lawyer, sit back down.

531
00:39:45.125 --> 00:39:48.665
I have a really bad personality, so I have trouble trusting people.

532
00:39:49.734 --> 00:39:51.864
What if someone swaps his sample with someone else's?

533
00:39:52.064 --> 00:39:53.404
- Hey. - Yes, sir.

534
00:39:53.504 --> 00:39:56.305
Keep your eyes on this, and bring me the results.

535
00:39:56.605 --> 00:39:57.605
Yes, sir.

536
00:39:57.904 --> 00:39:59.345
What do you think you're doing?

537
00:39:59.345 --> 00:40:00.975
Our department is in charge of handling this case.

538
00:40:00.975 --> 00:40:02.515
This case is mine.

539
00:40:02.515 --> 00:40:03.515
That guy...

540
00:40:04.084 --> 00:40:06.285
That young fool...

541
00:40:06.855 --> 00:40:08.855
was arrested by our team recruit.

542
00:40:09.515 --> 00:40:11.625
So it's our case now.

543
00:40:11.725 --> 00:40:12.924
Didn't you hear that yet?

544
00:40:13.524 --> 00:40:14.794
Who says that?

545
00:40:20.064 --> 00:40:21.095
(Special Written Order)

546
00:40:21.095 --> 00:40:22.895
"Seoun Police Station's Support Team".

547
00:40:22.895 --> 00:40:25.535
"Established in 2016 as a new team underneath..."

548
00:40:25.535 --> 00:40:27.134
"the homicide department,"

549
00:40:27.134 --> 00:40:29.305
"this team shall be the first in line..."

550
00:40:29.305 --> 00:40:31.845
"to take on a case that has been recognized by them..."

551
00:40:31.845 --> 00:40:34.475
"or that was asked by another police station..."

552
00:40:35.515 --> 00:40:37.114
"for support and assistance."

553
00:40:38.814 --> 00:40:40.714
You saw what's written here, right?

554
00:40:41.114 --> 00:40:42.114
Look.

555
00:40:42.785 --> 00:40:45.084
It was stamped by the chief of Seoun Police Station himself.

556
00:40:47.055 --> 00:40:48.855
My gosh, I can't believe this.

557
00:40:52.095 --> 00:40:56.265
Now, let's start a proper investigation.

558
00:40:59.535 --> 00:41:01.075
What do you think you're doing?

559
00:41:04.575 --> 00:41:06.504
I'm just doing this because he's cute.

560
00:41:09.745 --> 00:41:10.745
Hey.

561
00:41:11.714 --> 00:41:13.515
Do you know what my nickname is?

562
00:41:15.114 --> 00:41:17.254
They call me Crazy Dog. Crazy Dog.

563
00:41:17.884 --> 00:41:21.654
That's because I never let go of whatever I bite.

564
00:42:03.435 --> 00:42:05.064
No. No.

565
00:42:05.364 --> 00:42:08.504
Joon. Joon. Wake up.

566
00:42:09.205 --> 00:42:10.205
No. Joon.

567
00:42:21.515 --> 00:42:22.515
Joon.

568
00:42:24.254 --> 00:42:26.955
Are you okay? Did you get hurt badly?

569
00:42:27.424 --> 00:42:29.154
Stop causing a fuss. I'm fine.

570
00:42:30.924 --> 00:42:32.395
Thank you, Joon.

571
00:42:35.194 --> 00:42:38.605
You saved my life again.

572
00:42:39.535 --> 00:42:40.535
What?

573
00:42:41.435 --> 00:42:44.044
You always save my life like this.

574
00:42:44.345 --> 00:42:47.975
I feel like I always put you in danger and make you get injured.

575
00:42:51.785 --> 00:42:54.214
Tiffany and Hyo Jin were here until a while ago.

576
00:42:54.214 --> 00:42:57.325
They left after waiting for you to wake up.

577
00:42:57.785 --> 00:43:00.455
Tiffany's shadow has completely disappeared.

578
00:43:02.194 --> 00:43:03.395
Thanks to you,

579
00:43:04.694 --> 00:43:09.294
Mr. Oh, Tiffany, and Hyo Jin all managed to stay alive.

580
00:43:12.404 --> 00:43:14.205
You're incredible, Joon.

581
00:43:14.205 --> 00:43:16.375
Why is that because of me?

582
00:43:16.375 --> 00:43:17.805
I didn't save your boss.

583
00:43:17.805 --> 00:43:20.145
I wasn't even trying to help. He's the one who clung onto me.

584
00:43:20.145 --> 00:43:22.475
And I have absolutely nothing to do with...

585
00:43:22.475 --> 00:43:24.544
Tiffany and that little girl being able to stay alive.

586
00:43:25.415 --> 00:43:27.484
You're so modest.

587
00:43:28.355 --> 00:43:29.814
I'm not being modest.

588
00:43:29.814 --> 00:43:31.384
I didn't save anyone.

589
00:43:31.384 --> 00:43:33.725
I don't save human beings.

590
00:43:40.364 --> 00:43:43.134
No, Joon. Joon, No.

591
00:43:48.305 --> 00:43:49.305
Why?

592
00:43:50.444 --> 00:43:52.145
I... I'm a mess, aren't I?

593
00:43:52.245 --> 00:43:54.674
I should've at least washed my face. Seriously.

594
00:43:58.114 --> 00:43:59.114
Ha Ram.

595
00:44:01.114 --> 00:44:02.384
From now on,

596
00:44:04.754 --> 00:44:07.294
I want you to stay by my side. Okay?

597
00:44:09.154 --> 00:44:11.064
What... What?

598
00:44:11.364 --> 00:44:12.694
You promised...

599
00:44:14.035 --> 00:44:15.694
that you'll stay by my side.

600
00:44:17.305 --> 00:44:19.904
What... What? Oh, okay.

601
00:44:19.904 --> 00:44:22.734
Yes, but your mother told me...

602
00:44:22.734 --> 00:44:26.575
not to stay here for long, so I should go now.

603
00:44:26.575 --> 00:44:28.345
Rest up, Joon.

604
00:44:41.654 --> 00:44:43.765
The capsule. I forgot about the capsule.

605
00:44:50.665 --> 00:44:51.665
It's working again.

606
00:44:53.035 --> 00:44:55.504
Then why won't it work when I really need it?

607
00:45:00.845 --> 00:45:03.984
Anyway, where's that capsule?

608
00:45:06.855 --> 00:45:08.114
Where is that capsule.

609
00:45:10.955 --> 00:45:12.055
It's not here.

610
00:45:18.964 --> 00:45:20.964
The capsule. The capsule.

611
00:45:28.274 --> 00:45:29.504
Gosh, where is it?

612
00:46:35.234 --> 00:46:36.234
I'm sorry.

613
00:46:37.145 --> 00:46:38.674
I should've given this to you a long time ago.

614
00:46:41.345 --> 00:46:42.875
I was being too selfish.

615
00:47:12.245 --> 00:47:14.875
Dad, what's going to happen to me?

616
00:47:14.875 --> 00:47:16.614
There's this crazy detective.

617
00:47:16.614 --> 00:47:18.345
He keeps saying that he'll tear me into pieces.

618
00:47:18.345 --> 00:47:20.254
Don't worry. You'll get released soon.

619
00:47:20.355 --> 00:47:21.355
Really?

620
00:47:21.714 --> 00:47:22.915
Will I really get released, dad?

621
00:47:23.084 --> 00:47:26.125
Of course. You're a minor and a first-time offender.

622
00:47:26.185 --> 00:47:27.194
He's right.

623
00:47:27.194 --> 00:47:30.765
The juvenile act focuses on reformation rather than punishment.

624
00:47:30.794 --> 00:47:34.234
So even if one commits murder, they rarely get punished.

625
00:47:34.234 --> 00:47:35.294
What about weed?

626
00:47:35.794 --> 00:47:38.234
They took my hair sample.

627
00:47:38.234 --> 00:47:40.875
Just say that you thought it was a cigarette.

628
00:47:41.004 --> 00:47:42.834
You already agreed to the DNA test.

629
00:47:43.305 --> 00:47:45.375
So if you plead that you never intended on getting rid of evidence,

630
00:47:46.044 --> 00:47:47.375
they'll reject the warrant.

631
00:47:48.375 --> 00:47:50.084
Your visiting time's over.

632
00:47:55.584 --> 00:47:56.584
Don't worry.

633
00:48:13.274 --> 00:48:15.404
It was you, wasn't it? You did this, didn't you?

634
00:48:15.404 --> 00:48:17.044
What do you think you're doing?

635
00:48:17.544 --> 00:48:19.145
You knew that it was Sang Min, didn't you?

636
00:48:19.544 --> 00:48:21.475
That's why you tried to blame everything on me!

637
00:48:21.915 --> 00:48:22.915
Hey.

638
00:48:23.145 --> 00:48:25.515
If you stayed quiet, she would've become a gold digger,

639
00:48:25.515 --> 00:48:27.614
and you would've gotten released by being proved innocent.

640
00:48:28.214 --> 00:48:30.355
And even if you did get blamed for everything,

641
00:48:30.524 --> 00:48:33.055
you're already an ex-convict. How will that change anything?

642
00:48:34.924 --> 00:48:36.355
Then did you try to kill me...

643
00:48:37.165 --> 00:48:39.225
because things didn't go your way? Is that it?

644
00:48:39.225 --> 00:48:41.464
What? What are you talking about?

645
00:48:41.464 --> 00:48:42.834
Stop pretending like you don't know!

646
00:48:44.234 --> 00:48:45.964
I noticed that you got rid of all the evidence already.

647
00:48:46.404 --> 00:48:48.475
Do you think that will prevent me from proving that it was your doing?

648
00:48:48.475 --> 00:48:50.145
What are you talking about? You little jerk.

649
00:48:52.305 --> 00:48:54.075
I'm not going to get beaten up by you anymore.

650
00:48:59.345 --> 00:49:01.555
Has that jerk gone mad?

651
00:49:03.625 --> 00:49:04.924
We're in trouble, sir.

652
00:49:05.084 --> 00:49:06.524
I think Man Soo knows.

653
00:49:07.355 --> 00:49:10.125
What are you talking about? What does Man Soo know?

654
00:49:11.524 --> 00:49:14.165
I think he knows that he's not the culprit.

655
00:49:15.165 --> 00:49:16.165
Hey, Byung Ho.

656
00:49:16.805 --> 00:49:18.205
Did you tell him the truth?

657
00:49:19.105 --> 00:49:22.705
Do you think you'll get away with giving weed to Sang Min like this?

658
00:49:22.774 --> 00:49:24.975
I really didn't tell him anything.

659
00:49:25.705 --> 00:49:27.415
That bar hostess must've noticed something.

660
00:49:27.444 --> 00:49:29.214
Man Soo's in front of my house right now.

661
00:49:29.515 --> 00:49:30.915
What should I do?

662
00:49:32.884 --> 00:49:34.415
Call Man Soo, and ask him...

663
00:49:35.015 --> 00:49:36.285
to meet you at the summer house.

664
00:49:36.825 --> 00:49:38.685
And I want you to keep your mouth shut and go into hiding.

665
00:49:47.395 --> 00:49:48.395
What's wrong, Dad?

666
00:49:49.134 --> 00:49:50.334
Did something go wrong?

667
00:49:53.334 --> 00:49:54.634
Did I get caught?

668
00:49:55.904 --> 00:49:56.904
Am I going to prison?

669
00:49:58.904 --> 00:49:59.915
Don't worry.

670
00:50:00.375 --> 00:50:03.114
Everything will be fine as long as your uncle keeps quiet.

671
00:50:13.325 --> 00:50:16.125
But what is that jerk planning to do?

672
00:50:19.595 --> 00:50:20.595
Gosh.

673
00:50:21.535 --> 00:50:22.535
What...

674
00:50:26.535 --> 00:50:28.274
Did... Did a thief break in?

675
00:50:29.174 --> 00:50:30.404
It's not here.

676
00:50:31.245 --> 00:50:34.214
I searched the entire house, but it's not here.

677
00:50:34.975 --> 00:50:35.975
Gosh.

678
00:50:37.145 --> 00:50:40.455
I'm sure it'll be here as long as someone didn't throw it away.

679
00:50:40.455 --> 00:50:41.754
What if someone took it?

680
00:50:41.754 --> 00:50:43.285
If it was stolen by a human,

681
00:50:43.424 --> 00:50:45.055
it'll just seem like an empty capsule.

682
00:50:45.325 --> 00:50:47.794
And they won't be able to open it, so it'll be fine.

683
00:50:49.395 --> 00:50:50.564
But...

684
00:50:50.864 --> 00:50:54.535
if it was stolen by a grim reaper, it becomes a serious problem.

685
00:50:56.064 --> 00:50:59.265
The moment that grim reaper opens that capsule...

686
00:50:59.634 --> 00:51:03.134
Will... Will Ha Rim end up dying then?

687
00:51:04.044 --> 00:51:05.645
Will that start the countdown of her death?

688
00:51:05.645 --> 00:51:08.015
My gosh, stop it already, would you?

689
00:51:09.274 --> 00:51:11.984
Ha Rim can never die without my permission.

690
00:51:12.044 --> 00:51:13.044
Why?

691
00:51:14.185 --> 00:51:15.915
Why does her death need your permission?

692
00:51:17.725 --> 00:51:20.955
Why... Why do you think? I need her eyes to catch that loser.

693
00:51:21.125 --> 00:51:24.495
I'm going to take her as soon as I catch that loser. Don't worry.

694
00:51:26.294 --> 00:51:28.665
Then you better protect her well...

695
00:51:28.665 --> 00:51:31.964
because we have no idea when and how she'll end up dying.

696
00:51:32.234 --> 00:51:36.404
The only way for you to do that is to stay by her side at all times.

697
00:51:40.444 --> 00:51:41.444
"At all times"?

698
00:51:42.145 --> 00:51:43.814
At all times.

699
00:52:03.095 --> 00:52:06.064
Don't tell me that it fell into the hands of another grim reaper.

700
00:53:14.295 --> 00:53:16.295
Is Moo Gang not picking up yet?

701
00:53:17.065 --> 00:53:19.205
What in the world is he up to?

702
00:53:21.835 --> 00:53:23.875
Give me that. I'll do it.

703
00:53:25.275 --> 00:53:26.444
Really?

704
00:53:26.444 --> 00:53:28.514
Then I'll go and check on the soup in the kitchen.

705
00:53:28.514 --> 00:53:29.545
Okay.

706
00:54:00.145 --> 00:54:01.514
I knew it.

707
00:54:01.645 --> 00:54:04.514
444 is in Moo Gang's body now.

708
00:54:06.284 --> 00:54:07.455
So...

709
00:54:09.384 --> 00:54:10.824
444 has...

710
00:54:12.225 --> 00:54:13.855
fallen for a woman?

He'll die anyway.

714

Why is he sleeping here?

715
00:55:28.134 --> 00:55:29.804
He already took it off.

716
00:55:31.764 --> 00:55:34.304
I'm glad that the injury isn't anything serious.

That must've been why he killed my dad.

Get back here!

728

What? Is he the man I saw in Han Moo Gang's dream?

729
00:57:13.404 --> 00:57:14.975
I must track him down.

00:57:25.014 --> 00:57:26.415
He doesn't live here.

732
00:57:26.455 --> 00:57:28.714
Then do you know anything about the previous tenant...

733
00:57:28.714 --> 00:57:32.255
Goodness, I've lived here for more than a decade, okay?

00:57:45.464 --> 00:57:46.975
There's no record of him moving elsewhere.

Then...

738
00:57:48.574 --> 00:57:51.875
From this report, it looks like...

739
00:57:52.045 --> 00:57:54.714
a TV show on the local channel covered the arson case.

740
00:57:55.574 --> 00:57:57.984
Wouldn't we be able to find some clues...

741
00:57:57.984 --> 00:58:00.355
if we go ask the director of the show?

742

753
00:58:29.844 --> 00:58:32.085
Yes, I do remember the case.

00:58:32.085 --> 00:58:33.114
You do?

755
00:58:33.114 --> 00:58:35.054
I used to know a detective in Moojin.

756
00:58:35.054 --> 00:58:37.085
When I was having a drink with him,

757
00:58:37.085 --> 00:58:39.654
I heard that the case might not have been a simple arson case...

758
00:58:39.654 --> 00:58:41.895
but a murder case.

759
00:58:41.895 --> 00:58:43.725
So I started collecting information right away.

760
00:58:43.725 --> 00:58:46.194
But I had to stop in the middle of it.

761
00:58:46.565 --> 00:58:47.764
Why is that?

762
00:58:48.795 --> 00:58:52.165
It was because of the Moojin Time Mart collapse.

763
00:58:52.165 --> 00:58:54.475
I didn't have time to work on any other stories.

764
00:58:55.205 --> 00:58:56.904
It was one of the biggest disasters in history, you know.

765
00:58:56.904 --> 00:58:59.245
Everyone was all over the place back then.

766
00:58:59.344 --> 00:59:02.045
But why are you asking me about the case out of the blue?

767
00:59:04.014 --> 00:59:06.815
Do you know of anyone or his family members who might know where he is?

768
00:59:10.225 --> 00:59:13.355
Well... I'm not sure if you know this,

769
00:59:13.554 --> 00:59:15.855
but the victim's husband is Korean-Chinese.

770
00:59:15.855 --> 00:59:19.025
I heard that he moved to Korea after marrying her.

771
00:59:19.025 --> 00:59:21.594
As far as I know, he has no family here.

772
00:59:22.895 --> 00:59:24.605
Oh, that's right.

773
00:59:24.605 --> 00:59:27.005
The victim had a younger sister.

774
00:59:27.005 --> 00:59:30.375
Yes, I remember meeting her while working on the case.

775
00:59:30.375 --> 00:59:32.705
Could we get her contact information by any chance?

776
00:59:32.705 --> 00:59:35.915
Well, I'm not sure if I still have her contact information.

I do keep all of my notebooks,

778

but it was such a long time ago.

787
01:00:02.174 --> 01:00:05.205
and hung up on me even though I'm his superior. How rude.

788

I mean, I took time out of my busy day to look into it for him.

I went to the hospital, and they said you were changing hospitals.

He... He died?

816
01:02:20.775 --> 01:02:22.174
He went back to China...

817
01:02:22.174 --> 01:02:25.014
about two months after my sister died,

818
01:02:25.014 --> 01:02:26.884
so I lost touch with him too after that.

819

But about five years ago,

820
01:02:29.284 --> 01:02:31.384
I got a call from the police in Shenzhen.

821
01:02:31.384 --> 01:02:33.194
They said that he died...

822
01:02:33.324 --> 01:02:35.855
and that they want me to come and confirm that it's him.

823
01:02:35.855 --> 01:02:39.835
I think he got into a fight with someone while playing mahjong.

01:02:40.094 --> 01:02:43.134
I got him cremated right away...

825
01:02:43.435 --> 01:02:44.835
and scattered his ashes there.

826
01:02:58.014 --> 01:02:59.245
Dad...

827
01:03:03.125 --> 01:03:04.654
He died.

828
01:03:05.185 --> 01:03:06.554
That jerk.

829
01:03:07.654 --> 01:03:09.324
I knew that he'd get the punishment he deserved.

830
01:03:11.194 --> 01:03:12.364
I'm sorry, Dad.

831
01:03:13.295 --> 01:03:14.694
I'm really sorry.

832
01:03:19.464 --> 01:03:22.534
I'm sorry that I got you killed.

833
01:03:22.835 --> 01:03:24.304
It's all my fault.

834
01:03:25.674 --> 01:03:27.045
I shouldn't have seen...

835
01:03:28.045 --> 01:03:30.114
the shadow on that woman.

836
01:03:34.984 --> 01:03:37.185
A fire will break out at her place,

837
01:03:37.255 --> 01:03:39.824
and her clothes will catch fire.

838
01:03:41.125 --> 01:03:42.525
But it's strange.

839
01:03:42.525 --> 01:03:44.395
She's just staying still.

840
01:03:45.424 --> 01:03:46.634
She must be hot.

841
01:03:46.935 --> 01:03:48.295
Why isn't she moving?

842
01:03:48.795 --> 01:03:49.904
What?

843
01:03:50.065 --> 01:03:51.605
On the woman's belly,

844
01:03:52.034 --> 01:03:54.105
a piece of yellow paper is burning.

845
01:03:55.375 --> 01:03:58.145
She has a towel around her neck.

846
01:04:01.844 --> 01:04:03.745
I was too young to know then.

847
01:04:04.585 --> 01:04:07.255
When I looked back,

848
01:04:09.315 --> 01:04:11.585
I realized that the woman was killed by her husband.

849
01:04:12.324 --> 01:04:14.495
You reckoned that, didn't you?

850
01:04:15.995 --> 01:04:18.295
If I didn't touch the shadow,

851
01:04:18.725 --> 01:04:21.694
You wouldn't have investigated the case.

852
01:04:22.964 --> 01:04:24.435
Then that man...

853
01:04:25.105 --> 01:04:27.174
wouldn't have killed you.

854
01:04:28.134 --> 01:04:29.605
I'm sorry, Dad.

855
01:04:30.875 --> 01:04:32.674
I must have thought...

856
01:04:32.674 --> 01:04:35.245
that you would live once the shadow disappeared.

857
01:04:36.315 --> 01:04:37.784
I thought you wouldn't die.

858
01:04:43.484 --> 01:04:45.984
I tried to get rid of it,

859
01:04:46.554 --> 01:04:48.125
but it was pointless.

860
01:04:49.895 --> 01:04:51.764
In the end, you died.

861
01:05:05.375 --> 01:05:07.045
You and my dad...

862
01:05:07.375 --> 01:05:09.745
used to be like a real father and son.

863
01:05:13.984 --> 01:05:16.315
I was so jealous of you.

864
01:05:18.255 --> 01:05:21.424
I insisted that I'd go to the men's bath with him.

865
01:05:29.594 --> 01:05:31.904
Do you remember...

866
01:05:32.505 --> 01:05:33.574
why you became a police officer?

867
01:05:37.475 --> 01:05:39.645
It's probably because of my dad.

868
01:05:42.014 --> 01:05:43.614
After meeting my dad,

869
01:05:44.315 --> 01:05:45.984
You told me...

870
01:05:45.984 --> 01:05:48.214
that you wanted to be someone for the first time.

871
01:05:48.455 --> 01:05:49.714
You told me...

872
01:05:50.054 --> 01:05:52.755
that you wanted to be an amazing detective like my dad.

873
01:05:57.525 --> 01:05:59.125
Stop right there, you punk.

874
01:06:05.304 --> 01:06:06.734
Who are you?

875
01:06:08.475 --> 01:06:10.475
Me? I'm a police officer.

876
01:06:11.505 --> 01:06:13.344
You're too young to steal.

877
01:06:14.444 --> 01:06:15.475
Let's go.

878
01:06:15.475 --> 01:06:18.415
Dad. Please, Dad.

879
01:06:19.515 --> 01:06:20.984
Eat. They're getting soggy.

880
01:06:21.085 --> 01:06:22.555
You said you'll put me in jail.

881
01:06:24.284 --> 01:06:27.394
For now, let's eat first.

882
01:06:29.724 --> 01:06:31.995
You should try some. It's delicious.

883
01:06:40.635 --> 01:06:42.005
Soon after that,

884
01:06:43.074 --> 01:06:47.015
you went to your dad's in Seoul.

885
01:06:48.675 --> 01:06:51.284
And dad passed away a year later.

886
01:07:00.255 --> 01:07:01.694
Ever since then,

887
01:07:01.694 --> 01:07:05.024
I've never been happy even for a moment.

888
01:07:06.394 --> 01:07:08.364
I couldn't see Dad anymore.

889
01:07:08.564 --> 01:07:12.965
But I imagined that you were somewhere in this world...

890
01:07:13.534 --> 01:07:15.835
and lived on while enduring the pain.

891
01:07:19.745 --> 01:07:20.974
You were...

892
01:07:22.444 --> 01:07:24.415
like a support...

893
01:07:24.415 --> 01:07:26.885
that kept my life going.

894
01:07:58.045 --> 01:08:00.984
When she finds out that Han Moo Gang is dead...

895
01:08:27.715 --> 01:08:28.715
Kim Sun Young.

896
01:08:31.444 --> 01:08:33.085
How dare you stab me?

897
01:08:38.055 --> 01:08:39.125
Kim Sun Young.

898
01:08:40.654 --> 01:08:41.755
This is your last chance.

899
01:08:42.854 --> 01:08:44.165
Where's the tape?

900
01:08:45.595 --> 01:08:46.795
I don't know.

901
01:08:55.705 --> 01:08:57.005
- Where is it? - I don't know.

902
01:08:57.104 --> 01:08:58.805
Where's the tape?

903
01:08:59.404 --> 01:09:00.574
Tell me!

904
01:09:00.574 --> 01:09:02.574
Don't hit her! Don't hit my sister!

905
01:09:02.774 --> 01:09:04.814
What? Who are you?

906
01:09:05.644 --> 01:09:07.515
- Don't hit her! - What are you?

907
01:09:07.614 --> 01:09:09.585
Come here, you punk.

908
01:09:09.885 --> 01:09:10.984
No.

909
01:09:18.965 --> 01:09:20.064
No.

910
01:09:30.144 --> 01:09:32.345
I saw him in the photo.

911
01:09:51.564 --> 01:09:53.234
"Han Moo Gang".

912
01:09:56.095 --> 01:09:57.234
What?

913
01:09:59.404 --> 01:10:01.274
Isn't Joon and Han Moo Gang the same person?

914
01:10:02.474 --> 01:10:04.305
Come here, you punk.

915
01:10:04.644 --> 01:10:05.944
No, Moo Gang.

916
01:10:11.444 --> 01:10:12.484
Wait.

917
01:10:13.814 --> 01:10:15.184
Moo Chan.

918
01:10:16.955 --> 01:10:17.984
What?

919
01:10:19.795 --> 01:10:22.694
Does that mean Joon isn't Han Moo Gang?

920
01:10:41.974 --> 01:10:43.715
(Black)

921
01:10:43.845 --> 01:10:45.585
Are you telling me to spare him?

922
01:10:45.585 --> 01:10:47.784
If he dies, Seok also dies.

923
01:10:47.885 --> 01:10:50.125
I must find proof that they tried to kill me.

924
01:10:50.255 --> 01:10:52.385
I think that's where he was murdered.

925
01:10:52.385 --> 01:10:53.555
Where is that factory?

926
01:10:53.824 --> 01:10:56.625
What were you investigating all alone, Moo Gang?

927
01:10:56.765 --> 01:10:57.765
Joon.

928
01:10:57.765 --> 01:11:00.864
Have you forgotten that you're the Grim Reaper?

929
01:11:01.564 --> 01:11:03.404
What were you investigating until now?

930
01:11:03.404 --> 01:11:04.434
Get off me. Are you insane?

931
01:11:04.434 --> 01:11:07.574
I wish I had a face too.
