00:00:06.858 --> 00:00:10.069
By the way, I'm curious about something.

2
00:00:10.768 --> 00:00:12.329
Yes, go ahead.

3
00:00:12.938 --> 00:00:16.068
Are you this nice to all your contracted writers?

4
00:00:16.068 --> 00:00:17.309
Even to their family?

5
00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:21.978
Not necessarily.

6
00:00:22.748 --> 00:00:23.809
Really?

7
00:00:24.978 --> 00:00:28.079
Are you especially nice to Hyun Soo?

8
00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:30.449
Yes. I like...

9
00:00:31.388 --> 00:00:32.489
Hyun Soo.

10
00:00:40.758 --> 00:00:42.699
- Mr. Park. - But...

11
00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:45.299
she did turn me down a lot.

12
00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:50.669
- My goodness. - I see.

13
00:00:52.108 --> 00:00:54.608
It would've been nice if I was 20 years younger.

14
00:00:55.008 --> 00:00:56.648
Then I would've said yes to you.

15
00:00:58.278 --> 00:00:59.309
Honey.

16
00:01:01.218 --> 00:01:02.218
My gosh.

17
00:01:02.218 --> 00:01:03.648
- Eat up. - Okay.

18
00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.258
Eat up.

19
00:01:22.038 --> 00:01:23.068
(Hyun Soo)

20
00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:27.008
I see you called.

21
00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:30.409
I'm outside your place. I'll wait until you come home.

22
00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:32.109
Okay.

23
00:01:41.288 --> 00:01:42.558
What's going on?

24
00:01:43.629 --> 00:01:44.859
I want you to come with me.

25
00:01:45.588 --> 00:01:46.599
Where?

26
00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:57.838
This is your share.

27
00:02:07.818 --> 00:02:08.818
This is...

28
00:02:09.418 --> 00:02:11.018
Yes, it is.

29
00:02:29.068 --> 00:02:30.709
I'm sorry I made you anxious.

30
00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:09.679
Let's live together.

31
00:03:11.108 --> 00:03:12.209
Let's do that.

32
00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:27.429
(Temperature of Love)

33
00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.629
Boil it a bit more.

34
00:04:06.138 --> 00:04:07.168
Wrap it up nicely.

35
00:04:07.568 --> 00:04:08.638
Yes, Chef.

36
00:04:13.638 --> 00:04:16.248
Ha Sung, when you're done, help Min Ho.

37
00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:17.478
Yes, Chef.

38
00:04:24.248 --> 00:04:25.548
What do you want to do?

39
00:04:26.288 --> 00:04:27.719
Can you do it if the schedule gets moved up?

40
00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:29.829
I have to do what the company tells me to do.

41
00:04:30.558 --> 00:04:31.628
It's Hyun Soo I'm worried about.

42
00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:35.599
What happened?

43
00:04:35.728 --> 00:04:38.728
Speak of the devil. We were just talking about you.

44
00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:40.569
The TV schedule will be moved up.

45
00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:44.069
The program before us fell through, and they want us to fill it.

46
00:04:44.738 --> 00:04:45.738
What do you want to do?

47
00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:47.678
Is it up to me?

48
00:04:47.808 --> 00:04:49.139
It's up to us.

49
00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:50.978
We all have to agree.

50
00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:53.248
I want to do it.

51
00:04:54.079 --> 00:04:55.649
The script is already there. We can do it.

52
00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:58.819
Nice! That's what I wanted to hear!

53
00:04:58.819 --> 00:04:59.858
That hurt.

54
00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:02.988
I'll tell the broadcasting studio then.

55
00:05:03.228 --> 00:05:04.259
Okay.

56
00:05:08.358 --> 00:05:09.368
Hyun Soo.

57
00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:11.668
- Yi Bok. - Hello.

58
00:05:12.428 --> 00:05:13.639
What brings you here?

59
00:05:13.899 --> 00:05:14.998
I was here to see Jung Woo.

60
00:05:15.368 --> 00:05:16.709
Our TV schedule got moved up.

61
00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:18.868
It was moved up?

62
00:05:19.308 --> 00:05:21.409
Yes. The one that was scheduled before us fell through.

63
00:05:23.709 --> 00:05:25.248
Hyun Soo, can you do it?

64
00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:28.748
I will. This could be my last chance.

65
00:05:30.748 --> 00:05:31.788
Congratulations.

66
00:05:32.288 --> 00:05:34.759
Thanks. Is yours going well?

67
00:05:34.858 --> 00:05:39.128
Yes. I'm here with Director Min to discuss the cast.

68
00:05:39.928 --> 00:05:42.358
- I see. Good luck. - Thanks.

69
00:05:43.269 --> 00:05:44.298
Bye.

70
00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:47.938
You should do another revision before casting.

71
00:05:47.938 --> 00:05:48.998
Okay.

72
00:05:52.668 --> 00:05:53.709
Shall we go?

73
00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:55.878
I need to talk to Mr. Park.

74
00:05:57.949 --> 00:05:59.548
Goodness.

75
00:06:05.488 --> 00:06:07.089
Mr. Park, are you really going to do this?

76
00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:09.118
Do what?

77
00:06:09.118 --> 00:06:11.228
Why is Hyun Soo's getting produced before mine?

78
00:06:11.228 --> 00:06:13.899
It was the broadcasting station's decision, not mine.

79
00:06:14.358 --> 00:06:16.298
And it's none of your business.

80
00:06:16.428 --> 00:06:19.329
Of course it is. The cast will overlap.

81
00:06:20.238 --> 00:06:21.899
How is our casting going?

82
00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:23.509
I like Ms. Ji's personality.

83
00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:25.738
Why is she so feisty?

84
00:06:25.868 --> 00:06:27.608
Being feisty...

85
00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:30.308
doesn't do any damage.

86
00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:31.909
Because people don't want to fight.

87
00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:35.219
You two have a meeting.

88
00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:37.288
I need to go because I have an appointment.

89
00:06:40.058 --> 00:06:41.259
Do you have good news?

90
00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:42.829
Yes.

91
00:06:43.829 --> 00:06:47.329
People are responding to the new menu we uploaded.

92
00:06:48.058 --> 00:06:49.099
Are we getting a lot of reservations?

93
00:06:49.628 --> 00:06:51.069
Yes, we're slowly getting more.

94
00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:52.569
That's good.

95
00:06:53.938 --> 00:06:55.839
Don't get up. I'll answer it.

96
00:06:56.209 --> 00:06:57.269
Okay.

97
00:07:03.248 --> 00:07:04.349
Hello, it's Good Soup.

98
00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:06.649
Hello, this is Michelin Korea.

99
00:07:08.649 --> 00:07:09.748
Hi.

100
00:07:10.418 --> 00:07:12.349
Good Soup will be given...

101
00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:15.288
one star as the result of Michelin guide judging.

102
00:07:45.219 --> 00:07:46.259
Who was it?

103
00:07:47.558 --> 00:07:48.819
We got one star.

104
00:07:50.589 --> 00:07:51.628
Pardon?

105
00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:55.829
I just got the phone call. We got Michelin one star.

106

- Michelin... - One star?

107
00:08:02.969 --> 00:08:05.168
- Yes! - Nice!

108
00:08:07.079 --> 00:08:08.079
- Great! - Yes!

109
00:08:19.889 --> 00:08:20.988
Where are you going?

110
00:08:22.829 --> 00:08:25.688
- Come here! - It's awesome!

111
00:08:25.688 --> 00:08:26.699
Amazing.

112
00:08:27.159 --> 00:08:28.459
This is the start.

113
00:08:31.199 --> 00:08:34.398
Hyun Soo, can you do it? The schedule is so tight.

114
00:08:34.398 --> 00:08:35.439
I have to do it.

115
00:08:36.238 --> 00:08:38.169
Did you finish your research on the chefs?

116
00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:40.809
Not yet. I have to do some more.

Hi, Jung Sun.

119

Do you know who called me today?

120
00:08:53.758 --> 00:08:55.419
Who called you?

121
00:08:55.959 --> 00:08:57.028
Michelin did.

122
00:08:57.358 --> 00:08:59.189
I got one star from Michelin.

123
00:09:01.028 --> 00:09:02.128
Congratulations.

124
00:09:03.199 --> 00:09:04.699
Really. Congratulations.

125
00:09:05.329 --> 00:09:06.439
Thank you.

Could you make one like this?

131
00:09:57.388 --> 00:09:59.089
Is it for a proposal?

132
00:09:59.349 --> 00:10:01.189
Yes. I designed it.

133
00:10:01.919 --> 00:10:03.128
Okay, I'll make it.

134

135

Give me...

137
00:10:38.388 --> 00:10:39.459
some time.

138
00:11:11.158 --> 00:11:13.528
Yes, you have a reservation. Thank you.

139
00:11:13.528 --> 00:11:15.498
- Really? - This place is famous.

140
00:11:16.299 --> 00:11:18.469
- It's nice. - How pretty.

141
00:11:18.699 --> 00:11:19.768
It's delicious.

142
00:11:19.969 --> 00:11:22.268
I'm so excited.

143
00:11:29.949 --> 00:11:31.309
It tastes great.

144
00:12:07.248 --> 00:12:08.648
This is the appetizer for table eight.

145
00:12:08.748 --> 00:12:11.518
Table 12 ordered 4 lunch courses.

146
00:12:11.518 --> 00:12:13.488
4 lunch courses for table 12.

147
00:12:13.488 --> 00:12:14.758

He's doing great.

Aren't you bothered by that?

I am bothered.

But people can always end up liking other people.

167

So I'm sure he has some space for me in his heart.

Aren't you annoyed that I'm in his heart as well?

00:14:01.658 --> 00:14:04.469
Do you know that Good Soup got a Michelin Star?

174
00:14:05.329 --> 00:14:06.368
Yes.

175
00:14:06.898 --> 00:14:09.268
There are articles about it everywhere.

176
00:14:09.738 --> 00:14:11.069
Jung Sun must be happy.

177
00:14:11.569 --> 00:14:13.809
Hyun Soo's drama is also going to air earlier than planned.

178
00:14:14.378 --> 00:14:16.648
Both of them have a bright future ahead of them.

179
00:14:17.949 --> 00:14:19.248
What's wrong with my life?

180
00:14:20.219 --> 00:14:22.118
Why is everybody doing well apart from me?

181
00:14:38.569 --> 00:14:39.898
Let's live together.

182
00:14:41.268 --> 00:14:42.398
Let's do that.

183
00:14:49.549 --> 00:14:50.679
Give me...

184
00:14:51.748 --> 00:14:52.778
some time.

185
00:15:01.488 --> 00:15:04.089
(2 years ago, August 2015, Paris)

186
00:15:09.669 --> 00:15:10.799
(From Suncheon, To Seoul)

187
00:15:13.368 --> 00:15:17.408
(From Suncheon, To Seoul)

188
00:15:34.419 --> 00:15:35.658
(From Suncheon, To Seoul)

189
00:15:44.398 --> 00:15:47.169
(From Suncheon, To Seoul)

190
00:15:53.579 --> 00:15:56.049
The props are placed over here.

191
00:15:56.049 --> 00:15:58.478
- He's the camera director. - Hello.

192
00:15:58.478 --> 00:15:59.618
- Hello. - Hello.

193
00:15:59.618 --> 00:16:01.919
The camera monitors are over here.

194
00:16:02.278 --> 00:16:04.189
The director looks through this and says, "Cue" and "Cut".

195
00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:06.858
Doesn't each director have their own unique way to say that?

196
00:16:07.319 --> 00:16:09.059
How do you say it?

197
00:16:09.059 --> 00:16:11.459
I say, "Cut".

198
00:16:12.929 --> 00:16:15.258
- What? What? - I'm not going to comment on that.

199
00:16:16.398 --> 00:16:19.498
You know how our main male character studies cooking in France?

200
00:16:19.738 --> 00:16:20.839
We should go there.

201
00:16:21.969 --> 00:16:23.108
I don't want to go.

202
00:16:23.569 --> 00:16:26.138
She doesn't go on trips because she doesn't like riding planes.

203
00:16:26.579 --> 00:16:28.738
She only traveled once to Paris.

204
00:16:36.748 --> 00:16:41.258
(November 2015)

205
00:16:47.282 --> 00:16:50.514
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E33 Temperature of Love "What About Me?"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

206
00:16:58.238 --> 00:16:59.738
- Hello. - Hello.

207
00:17:00.039 --> 00:17:02.778
I came to meet Mr. On Jung Sun. Is he here?

208
00:17:03.049 --> 00:17:06.319
He resigned. He works somewhere else now.

209
00:17:07.118 --> 00:17:09.448
Do you know where he is by any chance?

210
00:17:09.648 --> 00:17:11.589
I don't know. I'm sorry.

211
00:17:12.049 --> 00:17:13.658
Okay. Thank you.

212
00:17:27.138 --> 00:17:28.769
My first trip abroad...

213
00:17:29.809 --> 00:17:31.368
was to Paris, the place where he was at.

214
00:17:33.509 --> 00:17:35.509
But I couldn't meet him.

215
00:17:41.349 --> 00:17:42.349
Jung Sun.

216
00:17:43.418 --> 00:17:45.089
I'm ready to give you an answer now.

217
00:18:01.269 --> 00:18:02.539
Congratulations again...

218
00:18:03.368 --> 00:18:04.839
on getting a Michelin Star.

219
00:18:05.269 --> 00:18:08.039
Congratulations on getting an air date for your drama.

220
00:18:08.708 --> 00:18:10.749
I'm really glad that things are going well for you.

221
00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:13.549
All that's left is for you to become more successful.

222
00:18:14.249 --> 00:18:16.349
I'm sure your drama is going to do well this time.

223
00:18:37.239 --> 00:18:38.269
I'm sorry.

224
00:18:39.579 --> 00:18:41.009
I pushed ahead too much, didn't I?

225
00:18:43.509 --> 00:18:46.319
I pressured you too much when I should've waited until you told me.

226
00:18:46.878 --> 00:18:47.878
No, it's okay.

227
00:18:49.489 --> 00:18:53.319
After pushing you away, I endured the five years...

228
00:18:54.718 --> 00:18:56.789
with a fluttering heart.

229
00:18:59.958 --> 00:19:02.928
My feelings for you were so strong that no one could ever enter.

230
00:19:05.569 --> 00:19:07.099
When I met you again,

231
00:19:08.099 --> 00:19:09.668
I thought we were destined for each other.

232
00:19:10.968 --> 00:19:14.339
When I met you again, and we fell in love,

233
00:19:15.809 --> 00:19:18.208
I found out I had never actually overcome...

234
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:21.118
the problems that I thought I had overcome.

235
00:19:23.418 --> 00:19:27.089
My dad and I tried so hard to live differently from each other's dads.

236
00:19:27.658 --> 00:19:29.428
But there was no need for us to try that way.

237
00:19:29.928 --> 00:19:31.458
Because we're already different people.

238
00:19:33.128 --> 00:19:36.829
I never expected you to be perfect.

239
00:19:39.938 --> 00:19:41.168
I wanted to...

240
00:19:43.039 --> 00:19:45.368
share your imperfect life.

241
00:19:51.378 --> 00:19:52.878
I'm not confident anymore.

242
00:19:55.878 --> 00:19:56.948
I'm sorry.

243
00:19:58.019 --> 00:19:59.718
I'll do better from now on.

244
00:20:01.188 --> 00:20:03.529
You're not the problem. I am.

245
00:20:08.559 --> 00:20:09.628
I'll wait for you.

246
00:21:53.339 --> 00:21:54.339
Hello.

247
00:21:54.569 --> 00:21:55.898
Is my son busy?

248
00:21:56.108 --> 00:21:57.809
Yes, he's really busy.

249
00:21:59.239 --> 00:22:00.479
Can't we get a table?

250
00:22:00.739 --> 00:22:04.678
You have to make a reservation even it's just for two people.

251
00:22:04.708 --> 00:22:05.708
Then we'll come back later.

252
00:22:06.079 --> 00:22:08.079
Let's go, Daniel. I'll buy you something nice.

253
00:22:08.878 --> 00:22:11.089
You always buy me something. What's the big deal?

254
00:22:12.188 --> 00:22:14.358
You can pay today. I don't feel like paying.

255
00:22:16.128 --> 00:22:17.888
Why are you acting so proud these days?

256
00:22:18.188 --> 00:22:21.158
My son's become successful. It's natural for me to be proud.

257
00:22:21.858 --> 00:22:22.898
Buy me food.

258
00:22:25.569 --> 00:22:26.638
Let's go.

259
00:22:27.468 --> 00:22:28.499
Let's eat tuna gimbap.

260
00:22:32.339 --> 00:22:35.739
Mr. Park, I have something to tell you regarding Chef On.

261
00:22:38.408 --> 00:22:41.218
Ino Electronics called and asked us to schedule a meeting with him...

262
00:22:41.218 --> 00:22:43.549
so that they can use him for their advertisement.

263
00:22:45.049 --> 00:22:46.688
People are also asking him to do lectures.

264
00:22:47.259 --> 00:22:48.688
What should I do?

265
00:23:04.408 --> 00:23:05.839
Hello, Chef On.

266
00:23:06.339 --> 00:23:07.378
It's been a while.

267
00:23:07.708 --> 00:23:08.708
- Please sit down. - Okay.

268
00:23:11.849 --> 00:23:14.249
Mr. Park wanted me to give you this.

269
00:23:15.918 --> 00:23:18.418
It's for canceling your contract with On Entertainment.

270
00:23:19.218 --> 00:23:21.858
He said he's willing to cancel the contract if that's what you wish.

271
00:24:01.759 --> 00:24:03.698
Jung Sun, I'm here.

272
00:24:04.099 --> 00:24:06.698
It's hard the first time, but it gets easier the second time.

273
00:24:07.198 --> 00:24:09.099
This place feels more comfortable this time.

274
00:24:10.638 --> 00:24:12.539
Just think of this place as my parents' home.

275
00:24:12.779 --> 00:24:14.408
Jung Sun's my guardian.

276
00:24:14.839 --> 00:24:16.908
I'm a son myself, but I'm really glad that...

277
00:24:16.908 --> 00:24:18.849
I don't have a mother like you.

278
00:24:19.349 --> 00:24:20.418
Daniel!

279
00:24:21.948 --> 00:24:23.118
You startled me.

280
00:24:24.188 --> 00:24:25.819
Why would you get startled from that?

281
00:24:28.188 --> 00:24:30.829
What are you looking at? Do we seem sweet?

282
00:24:31.358 --> 00:24:32.358
I'll bring you tea.

283
00:24:34.229 --> 00:24:35.658
What's Hyun Soo doing these days?

284
00:24:37.229 --> 00:24:38.829
She told us last time that she's writing a script for a drama.

285
00:24:39.638 --> 00:24:41.569
You have such a good memory.

286
00:24:42.539 --> 00:24:43.708
This is nothing.

287
00:24:46.839 --> 00:24:51.349
I have a friend who wishes to invest in your restaurant.

288
00:24:51.349 --> 00:24:52.448
Would you like me to introduce you to him?

289
00:24:52.448 --> 00:24:54.249
It's not a good idea to use other people's money.

290
00:24:54.448 --> 00:24:57.289
And he doesn't need an investment. He's going to earn a lot of money.

291
00:24:59.819 --> 00:25:01.118
Do you want strong tea?

292
00:25:01.559 --> 00:25:02.829
- Light, please. - Light, please.

293
00:25:04.989 --> 00:25:06.059
- Jinx. - Jinx.

294
00:25:20.138 --> 00:25:21.708
Why did you become so soft?

295
00:25:21.979 --> 00:25:23.309
You're even seeing me out.

296
00:25:24.749 --> 00:25:26.218
I guess success can really change people.

297
00:25:26.648 --> 00:25:28.678
I thought that maybe you acted out because...

298
00:25:28.678 --> 00:25:31.789
I acted cold towards you. So I'm changing my strategy.

299
00:25:31.989 --> 00:25:35.089
You made a strategy? Am I that important to you?

300
00:25:39.829 --> 00:25:42.329
But I did become a lot better after I met Daniel.

301
00:25:42.628 --> 00:25:45.769
I just spend a lot of money. Everything else is fine.

302
00:25:48.198 --> 00:25:49.668
How's Hyun Soo doing these days?

303
00:25:53.539 --> 00:25:54.809
I'm sure she's doing well.

304
00:25:55.979 --> 00:25:58.608
Is there something going on? Are you on bad terms with her?

305
00:25:59.779 --> 00:26:02.718
No, there's no reason for us to be on bad terms.

306
00:26:03.648 --> 00:26:05.019
She and I can relate to each other.

307
00:26:07.218 --> 00:26:09.829
She's also quite crazy about love.

308
00:26:16.229 --> 00:26:17.898
Let's talk in the office.

309
00:26:17.968 --> 00:26:19.769
- Did you bring your laptop? - Yes.

310
00:26:21.299 --> 00:26:22.569
Kyung, you can go home.

311
00:26:22.908 --> 00:26:24.839
No, it's okay. I'll go with you.

312
00:26:24.908 --> 00:26:26.309
There's nothing for you to do.

313
00:26:26.739 --> 00:26:29.208
We're going to talk about who to cast and edit the script.

314
00:26:29.339 --> 00:26:32.208
Okay. I always listen to you.

315
00:26:32.479 --> 00:26:33.979
You should listen to me instead.

316
00:26:34.418 --> 00:26:36.519
You should shave your beard.

317
00:26:36.648 --> 00:26:38.019
Are you trying to show that you're working hard?

318
00:26:38.249 --> 00:26:40.218
Why are you criticizing my personal preference?

319
00:26:40.218 --> 00:26:42.658
Go ahead, and keep your personal preference.

320
00:26:43.658 --> 00:26:44.759
Kyung, you win.

321
00:26:45.428 --> 00:26:46.628
- Right? - Yes.

322
00:26:48.958 --> 00:26:50.198
My gosh.

323
00:27:10.618 --> 00:27:11.618
Chef On.

324
00:27:12.519 --> 00:27:13.989
Chef Eric Song is here.

325
00:27:14.718 --> 00:27:15.718
Okay.

326
00:27:21.259 --> 00:27:23.529
What? Did you come out in the middle of work?

327
00:27:24.168 --> 00:27:26.668
I was making dough for noodles. I want to test something.

328
00:27:26.799 --> 00:27:28.499
If you heard that I was going to come,

329
00:27:28.898 --> 00:27:31.868
you should've been waiting for me in a suit.

330
00:27:32.408 --> 00:27:33.408
I'm sorry.

331
00:27:34.408 --> 00:27:36.009
I'm kidding. Let's sit down.

332
00:27:39.718 --> 00:27:42.148
That's actually what I like about you.

333
00:27:42.888 --> 00:27:44.648
What did you want to talk to me about?

334
00:27:44.849 --> 00:27:47.358
I have an offer. A shocking offer.

335
00:27:48.918 --> 00:27:51.188
My business partner, whom I've been working with for a long time,

336
00:27:51.658 --> 00:27:54.628
opened up a new restaurant in Hong Kong.

337
00:27:56.029 --> 00:27:58.569
I recommended you as the head chef.

338
00:27:59.739 --> 00:28:02.138
The investment and amount of time needed to cover for the deficit...

339
00:28:02.339 --> 00:28:04.208
will be decided on your terms.

340
00:28:04.968 --> 00:28:07.108
I can't take that offer because of Good Soup.

341
00:28:07.178 --> 00:28:09.479
You'll be able to run both restaurants.

342
00:28:09.849 --> 00:28:12.079
Of course, for the first six months...

343
00:28:12.079 --> 00:28:14.918
you need to focus on the opening, so it may be a bit difficult.

344
00:28:15.249 --> 00:28:17.888
Why are you giving me such a good offer?

345
00:28:18.148 --> 00:28:21.618
When you refused to develop a new menu with me,

346
00:28:22.188 --> 00:28:23.529
it left a strong impression.

347
00:28:25.158 --> 00:28:28.599
I want more chefs to be like you.

348
00:28:29.428 --> 00:28:31.168
I don't want them giving in to money.

349
00:28:31.368 --> 00:28:33.468
But of course, money is a good thing.

350
00:28:34.539 --> 00:28:35.799
Thank you.

351
00:28:48.279 --> 00:28:51.549
I'm sorry. I didn't think this far when Hyun Soo's drama...

352
00:28:51.888 --> 00:28:53.059
got fixed to be aired.

353
00:28:53.989 --> 00:28:55.789
Thank you for understanding.

354
00:28:56.358 --> 00:28:57.658
What else can I do?

355
00:28:59.259 --> 00:29:02.059
When two dramas from the same company compete against each other,

356
00:29:02.229 --> 00:29:03.628
it'll only be a loss on both ends.

357
00:29:03.868 --> 00:29:05.198
I'm fine with this,

358
00:29:06.638 --> 00:29:08.039
but what are you going to do about Writer Ji?

359
00:29:09.739 --> 00:29:10.868
Exactly.

360
00:29:13.279 --> 00:29:15.579
I don't want to be here when she throws a fit.

361
00:29:16.049 --> 00:29:19.309
I'll be waiting somewhere else. I'll meet her once you're done.

362
00:29:19.309 --> 00:29:21.178
We have to talk about the script.

363
00:29:21.819 --> 00:29:22.888
Good luck.

364
00:29:30.928 --> 00:29:32.829
I think we're going to have to work until late today.

365
00:29:33.128 --> 00:29:34.829
I'm ready to pull an all-nighter.

366
00:29:35.358 --> 00:29:37.729
How should we express the moment where the two characters...

367
00:29:37.729 --> 00:29:38.799
fall in love at first sight?

368
00:29:38.829 --> 00:29:40.299
Should we insert background music?

369
00:29:41.039 --> 00:29:43.269
Let's use computer graphics to make one of them get hit by lightning.

370
00:29:43.269 --> 00:29:44.608
Then that person will collapse.

371
00:29:46.708 --> 00:29:48.839
Let's begin.

372
00:29:49.378 --> 00:29:51.608
Are you trying to make me collapse?

373
00:29:52.718 --> 00:29:54.378
Please try to think of this from the company's point of view.

374
00:29:54.519 --> 00:29:56.218
Why would I have to do that?

375
00:29:56.218 --> 00:29:57.948
The company should be considerate of me.

376
00:29:58.489 --> 00:30:00.589
You didn't say anything back then. Why did this happen all of a sudden?

377
00:30:01.019 --> 00:30:03.928
I failed to think that far because the situation was so urgent.

378
00:30:04.188 --> 00:30:06.198
If you insist on airing it at that hour,

379
00:30:06.398 --> 00:30:08.729
two dramas from our company will be competing against each other.

380
00:30:08.729 --> 00:30:10.168
My drama was picked first.

381
00:30:10.168 --> 00:30:11.868
Hyun Soo only got picked as a replacement.

382
00:30:12.128 --> 00:30:13.668
Why do I have to be pushed back?

383
00:30:13.799 --> 00:30:16.638
They don't have a say in this because they're a replacement.

384
00:30:17.539 --> 00:30:21.009
You told me that my script was going to be a big hit.

385
00:30:21.339 --> 00:30:22.908
There's nothing we can do about this.

386
00:30:23.608 --> 00:30:25.349
I want my drama to be aired at that time.

387
00:30:26.749 --> 00:30:28.378
You better be prepared if my drama doesn't get chosen.

388
00:30:29.049 --> 00:30:30.448
Nowhere in the contract does it say that...

389
00:30:30.448 --> 00:30:32.918
I need to give in when two dramas end up competing against each other.

390
00:30:32.918 --> 00:30:34.259
- Writer Ji. - I'm not responsible...

391
00:30:34.259 --> 00:30:36.958
for this situation, the company is.

392
00:30:47.898 --> 00:30:48.898
Hong Ah.

393
00:31:14.128 --> 00:31:15.358
Is something wrong?

394
00:31:18.428 --> 00:31:20.638
- Hyun Soo. - What is it?

395
00:31:21.069 --> 00:31:22.638
Why do I have to be pushed back?

396
00:31:23.908 --> 00:31:26.178
Why am I constantly pushed back to be behind you?

397
00:31:29.749 --> 00:31:32.849
They told me to take the later spot because we'll air at the same time.

398
00:31:33.218 --> 00:31:35.648
Why should I when we're on different channels?

399
00:31:35.979 --> 00:31:37.749
That's not important.

400
00:31:38.349 --> 00:31:39.458
It's important.

401
00:31:40.418 --> 00:31:42.858
If you're pushed back once, you feel like you're constantly pushed back.

402
00:31:44.529 --> 00:31:45.858
I'm reminded of the nightmares...

403
00:31:46.559 --> 00:31:49.698
of failing the contests and living in defeat for the past five years.

404
00:31:51.299 --> 00:31:52.599
Nothing's working out.

405
00:31:56.668 --> 00:32:00.178
I think Won Joon really doesn't like me anymore.

406
00:32:02.608 --> 00:32:05.148
You have everything, but what about me?

407
00:32:06.718 --> 00:32:09.618
Jung Sun got a Michelin star. What about me?

408
00:32:21.928 --> 00:32:24.368
Everyone is the same when you look at them closely.

409
00:32:26.668 --> 00:32:28.299
You haven't reached success yet.

410
00:32:29.908 --> 00:32:31.938
I won't tell you why you haven't yet,

411
00:32:32.168 --> 00:32:33.938
because you'll be too happy.

412
00:32:35.608 --> 00:32:36.849
Tell me.

413
00:32:37.979 --> 00:32:39.079
I want to be consoled.

414
00:32:46.456 --> 00:32:49.856
(Episode 34 will air shortly.)
