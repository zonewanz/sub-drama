00:01:06.293 --> 00:01:07.712
I was right, wasn't I?

3
00:01:08.347 --> 00:01:10.359
You're sure now, right?

4
00:01:12.724 --> 00:01:13.855
Yes.

5
00:01:15.445 --> 00:01:16.904
I am sure now.

6
00:01:16.904 --> 00:01:19.495
See, what did I say, Joon?

7
00:01:19.495 --> 00:01:21.064
I know.

8
00:01:28.008 --> 00:01:30.115
We should just be friends.

9
00:01:30.115 --> 00:01:31.538
What?

10
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.559
Friends?

11
00:01:34.559 --> 00:01:36.451
Yes, friends.

12
00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:38.960
What? That's nonsense.

13
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.127
That just now was like...
a million, no, two million volts.

14
00:01:44.127 --> 00:01:48.138
I was totally like Pikachu right now.
I was nearly electrocuted.

15
00:01:48.138 --> 00:01:49.636
Not me.

16
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.076
You didn't feel it?

17
00:01:52.076 --> 00:01:54.838
No, I didn't.

18
00:01:54.838 --> 00:01:56.939
I was the only one who did?

19
00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.139
You felt it by yourself.

20
00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:01.457
I felt nothing.

21
00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.004
Let's draw a clear line now.

22
00:02:08.004 --> 00:02:12.632
You and I are nothing more than friends.

23
00:02:13.484 --> 00:02:14.946
Okay?

24
00:02:23.272 --> 00:02:25.302
<i>[Episode 9]</i>

25
00:02:44.905 --> 00:02:46.808
What do I do?

26
00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:17.163
No, no.

27
00:03:17.663 --> 00:03:19.132
This can't be real.

28
00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:21.314
How could this be real?

29
00:03:21.314 --> 00:03:22.471
I really...

30
00:03:22.471 --> 00:03:24.397
<i>gave her a good kiss.</i>

31
00:03:24.897 --> 00:03:25.942
How could she...

32
00:03:25.942 --> 00:03:28.024
<i>not feel the electricity?</i>

33
00:03:28.024 --> 00:03:29.322
Does this make sense?

34
00:03:29.322 --> 00:03:31.254
What are you doing?
Aren't you going to bed?

35
00:03:31.254 --> 00:03:33.232
You know, Joon...

36
00:03:33.232 --> 00:03:35.493
I know she likes me,
but she won't admit it.

37
00:03:35.493 --> 00:03:38.048
Stop talking and go to bed.

38
00:03:38.048 --> 00:03:39.468
I really...

39
00:03:39.468 --> 00:03:40.718
<i>gave her a good kiss.</i>

40
00:03:40.718 --> 00:03:41.816
How could she...

41
00:03:41.816 --> 00:03:43.267
<i>not feel the electricity?</i>

42
00:03:43.267 --> 00:03:44.361
<i>How?</i>

43
00:03:44.361 --> 00:03:45.768
Huh?

44
00:03:52.417 --> 00:03:56.177
Nothing could be clearer than this.

45
00:03:56.177 --> 00:03:57.719
What could this mean?

46
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.321
Why is she being like this?

47
00:04:04.506 --> 00:04:05.851
Jae Hoon.

48
00:04:06.794 --> 00:04:10.756
I worked so hard today.
Let me sleep in the bed.

49
00:04:10.756 --> 00:04:12.226
Just for today, okay?

50
00:04:12.226 --> 00:04:14.377
- Turn off the light.
- Okay.

51
00:04:47.856 --> 00:04:51.045
Both you and I were
completely wrong about Joon.

52
00:04:51.045 --> 00:04:52.529
She's an expert at
playing games with men.

53
00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:55.678
She is a master in playing hard to get.

54
00:04:55.678 --> 00:04:58.459
Please go to sleep.

55
00:04:58.459 --> 00:05:01.380
Where did she learn such a bad thing?

56
00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.841
Joon needs to realize
that's not what real love is.

57
00:05:04.841 --> 00:05:08.300
But now that she's
using her skills on me...

58
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.791
I have to respond.

59
00:05:09.791 --> 00:05:12.440
Hey, I said go to sleep.

60
00:05:14.411 --> 00:05:17.514
What am I supposed to do now?

61
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.079
Since she's started using her skills,
should I respond similarly or not?

62
00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:28.675
Where did you learn such a bad thing
to make me suffer, Joon?

63
00:05:29.322 --> 00:05:33.950
Today is finally the day of Chef Jo's
bulgogi bowl's launch, so stay alert.

64
00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.274
- Go over all your tasks again.
- Yes.

65
00:05:36.274 --> 00:05:38.250
Make sure all the
PR materials are going out.

66
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.027
Manager Kim, make sure
there are no operations issues.

67
00:05:41.027 --> 00:05:42.293
Yes, I'll do that.

68
00:05:45.565 --> 00:05:46.966
Section Chief Kwon.

69
00:05:46.966 --> 00:05:49.868
Compile a report of
the market response of the first day.

70
00:05:49.868 --> 00:05:52.796
- Get it to Managing Director Seol.
- Yes, Section Chief Yang.

71
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.635
Gosh, it doesn't make sense.

72
00:06:16.901 --> 00:06:19.829
It doesn't make sense.
It doesn't make sense.

73
00:06:19.829 --> 00:06:21.524
It doesn't make sense.

74
00:06:27.861 --> 00:06:29.601
What are you planning to do?

75
00:06:29.601 --> 00:06:30.623
With what?

76
00:06:30.623 --> 00:06:32.654
What are you doing
with the Seman products?

77
00:06:32.654 --> 00:06:34.892
Why? Are you worried?

78
00:06:34.892 --> 00:06:37.281
Tell President Jang
to prepare for the lawsuit.

79
00:06:37.281 --> 00:06:39.733
He'll realize how serious it is
to steal our products.

80
00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:41.692
We didn't put "Seman" on those products.

81
00:06:41.692 --> 00:06:44.012
They'll be sold with
the Gangsu Foods label.

82
00:06:44.012 --> 00:06:47.651
The product isn't being stolen,
so don't sue, okay?

83
00:06:47.651 --> 00:06:51.142
You don't think selling under
the Gangsu label will cause problems?

84
00:06:51.142 --> 00:06:52.825
You think it'll even sell?

85
00:06:52.825 --> 00:06:54.877
We'll have to try and sell to know.

86
00:06:54.877 --> 00:06:57.635
Where will you sell it?
Do you have a sales distributor?

87
00:06:57.635 --> 00:06:59.923
I do have one place.

88
00:07:00.635 --> 00:07:03.067
I'm going to go try that place now.

89
00:07:03.067 --> 00:07:07.587
Don't go to the wrong place and
bring embarrassment to Gangsu Foods.

90
00:07:07.587 --> 00:07:09.187
Just give up now.

91
00:07:09.187 --> 00:07:13.892
"Embarrassment" and "give up"
are not in my dictionary, my friend.

92
00:07:14.231 --> 00:07:15.724
Bye, now.

93
00:07:15.724 --> 00:07:17.604
Hey.

94
00:07:17.604 --> 00:07:20.911
Cover for me with
Section Chief Yang while I'm out.

95
00:07:22.058 --> 00:07:23.858
Help me out, friend.

96
00:07:44.046 --> 00:07:47.329
I love you. Muah.

97
00:07:53.632 --> 00:07:58.111
It's been a while since I last worked
into the night, so my whole body hurts.

98
00:07:58.988 --> 00:08:03.185
What's Hyuk so confident about
that he's making such bold claims?

99
00:08:03.185 --> 00:08:05.580
The bosses will be up in arms
once they find out.

100
00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.560
Well, he says he'll figure it all out.

101
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.832
We should wait and see.

102
00:08:09.832 --> 00:08:11.601
Does he have something he can rely on?

103
00:08:11.601 --> 00:08:15.942
He said has a hidden card or something
that he can't tell us about.

104
00:08:15.942 --> 00:08:18.231
- A hidden card?
- Hidden card?

105
00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:19.404
Yes.

106
00:08:21.712 --> 00:08:24.319
I love you! Muah.

107
00:08:25.856 --> 00:08:27.135
Oh my goodness.

108
00:08:32.379 --> 00:08:33.527
What is it?

109
00:08:33.527 --> 00:08:37.128
Oh, uh... I can't get
this window cleaned very well.

110
00:08:37.128 --> 00:08:39.561
There must be a lot of frost on it.

111
00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:41.465
That's odd.

112
00:08:44.055 --> 00:08:46.074
Come on, Uncle.

113
00:08:46.074 --> 00:08:47.789
No, I can't!

114
00:08:47.789 --> 00:08:51.166
This is a really good product
you can't afford to lose out on.

115
00:08:51.166 --> 00:08:54.411
Hey, how can I accept
the beef rice bowl back again?

116
00:08:54.411 --> 00:08:56.045
How does that make sense?

117
00:08:56.045 --> 00:09:00.227
Gangsu Foods has already
made their new product.

118
00:09:00.227 --> 00:09:02.065
Chef Jo's bulgogi.

119
00:09:02.065 --> 00:09:04.978
That's going to be
distributed in every store.

120
00:09:04.978 --> 00:09:10.138
All I'm saying is just make a small spot
for it next to Chef Jo's product.

121
00:09:10.138 --> 00:09:11.617
I'm not asking for much.

122
00:09:11.617 --> 00:09:13.820
Do it for me until the products sell out.

123
00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.766
Just a month, no, two weeks.

124
00:09:17.397 --> 00:09:19.050
Come on, Uncle.

125
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:21.744
Did you even get permission for this?

126
00:09:22.463 --> 00:09:25.253
I'm asking if your father knows.

127
00:09:25.253 --> 00:09:30.544
Obviously, there's a reason
why I'm coming directly to you.

128
00:09:30.544 --> 00:09:32.574
You rascal, have you no fear?

129
00:09:32.574 --> 00:09:35.075
Hey, both you and me...

130
00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:38.849
do you want to get us
killed by your dad?

131
00:09:38.849 --> 00:09:41.429
That's why we need
to do this in secret.

132
00:09:41.429 --> 00:09:45.829
This will be our second secret pact.

133
00:09:45.829 --> 00:09:47.208
Second?

134
00:09:47.799 --> 00:09:48.940
What was the first one?

135
00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.914
Oh, you know.

136
00:09:50.914 --> 00:09:54.568
You know, those pills
I got for you before.

137
00:09:54.568 --> 00:09:56.347
Are you taking them well?

138
00:09:56.956 --> 00:09:59.972
What pills are you talking about? Huh?

139
00:10:04.799 --> 00:10:06.978
Vi... a...

140
00:10:06.978 --> 00:10:09.344
You punk! That's a secret.

141
00:10:09.344 --> 00:10:13.315
Uncle, don't you understand how much
your nephew worries about your health?

142
00:10:13.315 --> 00:10:16.244
Hey, you're being so petty.

143
00:10:16.244 --> 00:10:18.246
Hey, hey, hey!

144
00:10:18.246 --> 00:10:20.836
You punk! Stand right there.

145
00:10:20.836 --> 00:10:22.518
Stand right there?

146
00:10:22.518 --> 00:10:24.319
That's your issue, Uncle.

147
00:10:24.319 --> 00:10:27.013
How is it lately? Is it okay?

148
00:10:27.847 --> 00:10:30.102
Why, you little rascal!

149
00:10:30.102 --> 00:10:32.123
Hey, you!

150
00:10:32.123 --> 00:10:34.934
Seriously, you little rascal. I got you.

151
00:10:34.934 --> 00:10:36.959
You'd better shut your mouth.

152
00:10:36.959 --> 00:10:41.254
Uncle, you can punish me.
I will cheer for you. Gangsu!

153
00:10:42.383 --> 00:10:43.820
Why isn't he coming?

154
00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.881
Oh, I'm getting worried.

155
00:10:46.881 --> 00:10:49.576
What's taking him so long?

156
00:10:49.576 --> 00:10:50.646
There he is!

157
00:10:50.646 --> 00:10:53.343
- Where, where?
- Hyuk!

158
00:10:54.541 --> 00:10:55.631
Hey!

159
00:10:55.631 --> 00:10:57.411
What happened? Can we sell the product?

160
00:10:57.411 --> 00:10:58.792
We can't?

161
00:11:00.033 --> 00:11:03.049
Of course, the new product
is being displayed everywhere.

162
00:11:03.049 --> 00:11:04.364
- We can sell it.
- He says we can.

163
00:11:04.364 --> 00:11:05.631
- We can?
- Yes.

164
00:11:05.631 --> 00:11:07.440
Wow, wow!

165
00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.871
Wow, Mister Byun.
You did it again. You did.

166
00:11:10.871 --> 00:11:14.326
Oh my goodness. I'm so emotional.

167
00:11:14.326 --> 00:11:17.675
Hey, then, do we get money?
I mean, a bonus.

168
00:11:17.675 --> 00:11:19.699
- Of course!
- Yeah!

169
00:11:25.789 --> 00:11:27.743
Everything's good about you and all.

170
00:11:27.743 --> 00:11:30.551
But you always take so long...
your progression.

171
00:11:34.983 --> 00:11:37.215
<i>As I thought, a master of playing games.</i>

172
00:11:37.844 --> 00:11:40.973
<i>I should be pushing her away
at times like these.</i>

173
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:45.667
<i>Ah, I just can't do it when I see Joon.</i>

174
00:11:46.169 --> 00:11:48.018
Joon, wait up!

175
00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.550
Joon, wait for me.

176
00:11:52.015 --> 00:11:55.065
Those are the good days.

177
00:11:56.084 --> 00:11:58.291
Madam Ahn, that hurt.

178
00:11:58.291 --> 00:12:00.203
Yeah!

179
00:12:00.203 --> 00:12:02.421
Oh yeah!

180
00:12:16.651 --> 00:12:18.799
Oh, is this where it is?

181
00:12:18.799 --> 00:12:19.924
Yes.

182
00:12:36.624 --> 00:12:39.354
That kid caused
another big problem this time.

183
00:12:39.354 --> 00:12:42.773
Doesn't he know he can't just make
products with previous subcontractors?

184
00:12:42.773 --> 00:12:47.145
It seems he wants to share in the
profits and make a deal with us.

185
00:12:47.145 --> 00:12:51.574
Just to help that subcontractor,
he sabotages the launch of a new product?

186
00:12:51.574 --> 00:12:54.675
He's not just crazy.
He's beyond that.

187
00:12:54.675 --> 00:12:55.705
What should I do?

188
00:12:55.705 --> 00:12:57.556
There's nothing to think about.

189
00:12:57.556 --> 00:12:59.576
I'll have to support the other side.

190
00:12:59.576 --> 00:13:01.325
Support the other side?

191
00:13:01.325 --> 00:13:06.550
You want to give us more support
with Chef Jo's bulgogi product?

192
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:11.055
You prepared this new product for a
long time and the response is good.

193
00:13:11.055 --> 00:13:14.368
Of course, we should give you as
much financial support as you need.

194
00:13:15.118 --> 00:13:18.089
We are marketing it more than enough.

195
00:13:18.089 --> 00:13:22.579
Increase the marketing during prime time.
The costs will be covered.

196
00:13:30.003 --> 00:13:32.383
He's very concerned by this.

197
00:13:35.743 --> 00:13:38.348
<i>One refreshing bite for you
and one for me.</i>

198
00:13:38.348 --> 00:13:41.177
<i>Ah... so delicious.</i>

199
00:13:41.177 --> 00:13:44.039
<i>Chef Jo's Bulgogi Bowl.</i>

200
00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:09.237
What should we do?

201
00:14:09.982 --> 00:14:12.820
It was a consistent seller before.

202
00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:15.200
I didn't think it would
go down like this.

203
00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.180
How could it not?

204
00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:18.533
Look at that.

205
00:14:18.533 --> 00:14:22.223
Whenever the TV is turned on,
Chef Jo's face is on it.

206
00:14:22.223 --> 00:14:25.545
Of course, the new product
will sell better.

207
00:14:26.103 --> 00:14:30.608
Once you lose your spot
in the market, it's over for you.

208
00:14:34.773 --> 00:14:38.223
Mister, isn't there a way?

209
00:14:38.223 --> 00:14:41.044
You were once an expert
in PR and marketing.

210
00:14:41.044 --> 00:14:42.200
Yeah?

211
00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.935
Isn't there another way, Mister?

212
00:14:49.984 --> 00:14:51.651
Why are you all asking me?

213
00:14:51.651 --> 00:14:54.682
Realistically, it's too hard to succeed.

214
00:14:54.682 --> 00:14:58.339
How can you beat a big company like that?

215
00:14:58.854 --> 00:15:02.665
Still, give us one idea.

216
00:15:02.665 --> 00:15:06.415
Something you would do
when you're at the edge of a cliff.

217
00:15:06.415 --> 00:15:07.897
There must be something.

218
00:15:07.897 --> 00:15:09.993
Oh, gosh.

219
00:15:09.993 --> 00:15:12.546
Well, let's see...

220
00:15:13.539 --> 00:15:16.114
It's all right.

221
00:15:16.664 --> 00:15:20.551
It was more than enough
that I got my product in the stores.

222
00:15:20.551 --> 00:15:24.179
I'm grateful for your efforts.

223
00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:40.075
Mister Kim.

224
00:15:41.171 --> 00:15:42.491
Ki Sub.

225
00:15:42.491 --> 00:15:43.695
Mister Kim.

226
00:15:43.695 --> 00:15:45.959
Mister!

227
00:15:55.256 --> 00:15:56.688
What, what?

228
00:15:58.599 --> 00:16:03.958
There is a method you can use
when you don't have the finances.

229
00:16:10.767 --> 00:16:12.410
<i>Wow.</i>

230
00:16:13.938 --> 00:16:16.525
<i>First rule of marketing.</i>

231
00:16:17.388 --> 00:16:19.863
Tap into the subconscious.

232
00:16:20.429 --> 00:16:23.414
Hello, customers at Gangsu Mart.

233
00:16:23.414 --> 00:16:28.581
Today, Gangsu Foods beef rice bowls
are buy three, get one free.

234
00:16:28.581 --> 00:16:32.592
It tastes just like the beef our mothers
cooked for us back when we were young.

235
00:16:32.592 --> 00:16:34.908
When we went back to our home
to visit our grandmothers...

236
00:16:34.908 --> 00:16:38.508
<i>Where were her boundaries?</i>

237
00:16:38.508 --> 00:16:43.557
<i>How could she be so uniquely beautiful
even in a situation like this?</i>

238
00:16:43.557 --> 00:16:45.871
Young man, let me try a sample.

239
00:16:45.871 --> 00:16:47.239
Yes.

240
00:16:48.806 --> 00:16:51.050
Let me know if you'd like to try more.

241
00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:52.233
Please enjoy.

242
00:16:52.233 --> 00:16:57.148
Oh, here's that Gangsu Foods
beef rice bowl that I like.

243
00:16:57.148 --> 00:16:59.338
Oh, you know it.
We have a buy three, get one free sale.

244
00:16:59.338 --> 00:17:05.168
Yes, even if there is a new product,
this really is the best.

245
00:17:05.168 --> 00:17:07.879
This works out great. Okay.

246
00:17:07.879 --> 00:17:09.384
This is where it was.

247
00:17:09.384 --> 00:17:10.840
Oh my.

248
00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:14.549
Oh, Gangsu Foods beef rice bowl.
I heard it was good.

249
00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:16.680
Please give me some.

250
00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.173
- It looks good.
- I heard it's very good.

251
00:17:19.173 --> 00:17:23.373
<i>There's nothing better than word of mouth
to get into the subconscious mind.</i>

252
00:17:23.373 --> 00:17:26.642
<i>"This is good. It's really delicious."</i>

253
00:17:26.642 --> 00:17:28.654
<i>You need to drive that home.</i>

254
00:17:28.654 --> 00:17:29.976
Oh my goodness!

255
00:17:29.976 --> 00:17:32.904
I've found Gangsu Foods beef rice bowls.

256
00:17:32.904 --> 00:17:36.561
My youngest son is so picky,
but he ate this and got strong.

257
00:17:36.561 --> 00:17:39.209
Then got into the college he wanted.

258
00:17:39.209 --> 00:17:40.523
Oh, really?

259
00:17:40.523 --> 00:17:44.538
I couldn't find it in the other stores.
I'll buy a lot while I'm here.

260
00:17:44.538 --> 00:17:46.950
- You can't buy it all.
- I'd better buy a box.

261
00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:48.789
I'm going buy it too.

262
00:17:48.789 --> 00:17:50.746
- I'll take it all.
- Give me more.

263
00:17:50.746 --> 00:17:53.028
- Give me two more.
- Give me some, please.

264
00:17:53.028 --> 00:17:55.292
Oh my. They're all gone.

265
00:17:55.292 --> 00:17:59.215
I'd better save some for myself.

266
00:18:02.422 --> 00:18:04.407
Have you heard of viral marketing?

267
00:18:04.407 --> 00:18:08.883
It may not be the right method,
but we could give it a try.

268
00:18:08.883 --> 00:18:12.796
We're not in a position
to pick and choose.

269
00:19:14.565 --> 00:19:18.026
Excuse me. Please let me by.

270
00:19:18.026 --> 00:19:22.392
It keeps running out.
I just can't keep it stocked.

271
00:19:22.392 --> 00:19:23.553
Where is this from?

272
00:19:23.553 --> 00:19:25.479
It's from Gangsu Foods.

273
00:19:25.479 --> 00:19:26.876
It's very good.

274
00:19:26.876 --> 00:19:29.245
- Yes, yes. Here you go.
- I think it's working.

275
00:19:29.245 --> 00:19:30.491
I think you're right.

276
00:19:30.491 --> 00:19:33.564
It's all gone already.
This is a big problem.

277
00:20:01.543 --> 00:20:03.501
Managing Director.

278
00:20:03.501 --> 00:20:05.242
May I sit with you?

279
00:20:05.242 --> 00:20:07.584
I wanted to see you, so this works out.

280
00:20:18.874 --> 00:20:22.139
I wanted to discuss something with you.

281
00:20:24.584 --> 00:20:28.905
Why did you assign Hyuk to this task?

282
00:20:30.032 --> 00:20:31.952
I was curious.

283
00:20:31.952 --> 00:20:36.129
I wanted to know what
kind of mind this Byun Hyuk has.

284
00:20:36.129 --> 00:20:38.219
I wanted to know
how far those qualities went.

285
00:20:38.219 --> 00:20:39.797
His qualities?

286
00:20:39.797 --> 00:20:43.909
Is he a person who can move
and act according to his thoughts?

287
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:48.431
Can he recognize the wall of reality
that he will eventually run into?

288
00:20:48.559 --> 00:20:54.396
Also, will he eventually
overcome that wall or not?

289
00:21:08.711 --> 00:21:12.508
That guy... he should've taken it easy.

290
00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:19.090
Hey, Intern! Where are you? Intern!

291
00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:20.946
Yes, Section Chief Yang.

292
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:24.421
Hey, Intern!

293
00:21:24.421 --> 00:21:27.026
Hey, are you crazy?

294
00:21:27.563 --> 00:21:31.892
You made those beef rice bowls with
Seman and labeled them as Gangsu Foods.

295
00:21:31.892 --> 00:21:34.294
Byun Hyuk, you did it, didn't you?

296
00:21:34.294 --> 00:21:37.524
You asked me two, three times when
we were terminating the contract.

297
00:21:37.524 --> 00:21:39.472
You were planning it out
since then, right?

298
00:21:39.472 --> 00:21:43.912
Sorry, but the products weren't
distributed without permission.

299
00:21:43.912 --> 00:21:45.953
They are being sold
using the existing recipe.

300
00:21:45.953 --> 00:21:47.778
They've agreed to share in profits.

301
00:21:47.778 --> 00:21:51.400
They will pay the royalties.
Then there are no problems, right?

302
00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.712
No problems?

303
00:21:52.712 --> 00:21:54.334
No problems, you say?

304
00:21:54.334 --> 00:21:58.805
Chef Jo is causing a big fuss and
threatening to sue for damages!

305
00:21:58.805 --> 00:22:01.490
What? Chef Jo?

306
00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:05.196
He wants to know why we had a contract
with him, yet sold a competing product.

307
00:22:05.196 --> 00:22:09.005
He says Gangsu Foods lied to him
and breached contract.

308
00:22:09.005 --> 00:22:11.199
He's causing a big scene right now!

309
00:22:11.199 --> 00:22:13.867
What's the big deal about selling both
that it's a breach of contract?

310
00:22:13.867 --> 00:22:17.515
Hey, it's because
he's lost that much profit.

311
00:22:17.515 --> 00:22:19.427
I doubt it made that much difference.

312
00:22:19.427 --> 00:22:22.078
I really can't get through to you.

313
00:22:22.078 --> 00:22:24.269
Section Chief Kwon,
give me the sales report.

314
00:22:24.269 --> 00:22:25.934
Ah, okay.

315
00:22:33.107 --> 00:22:36.510
Seman sold this many units?

316
00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:38.740
I seriously think I'm going insane!

317
00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:40.345
This is why Chef Jo is going nuts.

318
00:22:40.345 --> 00:22:43.569
Oh, amazing! They sold this many?

319
00:22:43.569 --> 00:22:45.823
Wow, this is totally great!

320
00:22:47.008 --> 00:22:48.584
Wow.

321
00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:57.044
What do we do?

322
00:22:57.044 --> 00:22:59.774
Hyuk is getting in big trouble
with Section Chief Yang.

323
00:22:59.774 --> 00:23:01.122
I can see why.

324
00:23:01.122 --> 00:23:03.572
Who knew we'd sell so many?

325
00:23:04.594 --> 00:23:06.899
What should we do, Joon?

326
00:23:09.242 --> 00:23:11.984
Should I meet with Chef Jo?

327
00:23:11.984 --> 00:23:16.015
Hey, do you think you can fix this issue?

328
00:23:16.015 --> 00:23:17.885
You're being way too arrogant.

329
00:23:17.885 --> 00:23:22.564
What were you thinking, acting on your
own in a matter that affects our sales?

330
00:23:22.564 --> 00:23:25.057
What? Is it because
you're the CEO's son?

331
00:23:25.057 --> 00:23:26.705
Do I look seem like a joke to you?

332
00:23:26.705 --> 00:23:27.936
It wasn't like that at all.

333
00:23:27.936 --> 00:23:29.869
Then what was it?

334
00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:35.146
Honestly, when President Jang
was on his knees here...

335
00:23:35.146 --> 00:23:37.728
I'm really not making any excuses,
Section Chief Yang.

336
00:23:37.728 --> 00:23:39.601
I really am sorry.

337
00:23:40.757 --> 00:23:45.058
When a man who tried to hang himself
was on his knees asking for help...

338
00:23:45.058 --> 00:23:47.225
didn't you all feel heartache?

339
00:23:48.323 --> 00:23:52.193
I didn't go against company policy
to side with subcontractors.

340
00:23:52.193 --> 00:23:54.686
Still, these are people
we worked with for a long time.

341
00:23:54.686 --> 00:23:58.881
At the very least,
shouldn't we cover their losses?

342
00:23:58.881 --> 00:24:02.799
We can't leave others to die
for the sake of our profit.

343
00:24:02.799 --> 00:24:05.888
We're not all those
kinds of monsters, are we?

344
00:24:05.888 --> 00:24:08.698
Mister Byun Hyuk,
watch what you're saying.

345
00:24:08.698 --> 00:24:12.138
Do you think the people here
don't care about others as much as you?

346
00:24:12.138 --> 00:24:13.298
Then what is it?

347
00:24:13.298 --> 00:24:15.958
What's so important about company policy?

348
00:24:15.958 --> 00:24:18.919
Isn't is okay to get a little
smaller bonus for the new product?

349
00:24:18.919 --> 00:24:22.029
Bonus? I'm glad you brought it up.

350
00:24:22.029 --> 00:24:24.318
It's not like we get much.

351
00:24:24.318 --> 00:24:28.854
Hey, do you think we're doing this
over a little money?

352
00:24:28.854 --> 00:24:29.860
Then what is it?

353
00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:32.257
We're scared of the higher-ups!

354
00:24:34.321 --> 00:24:37.450
If our performance suffers,
we don't get promoted.

355
00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:41.450
Then we'll be out of the company
before you know it.

356
00:24:42.312 --> 00:24:45.787
Hey, President Jang isn't
the only desperate person.

357
00:24:45.787 --> 00:24:49.067
Everyone here is trying
not to get pushed out.

358
00:24:49.067 --> 00:24:52.619
We're all working like crazy
trying to survive!

359
00:24:53.424 --> 00:24:55.984
You may not care since
you're the CEO's son.

360
00:24:55.984 --> 00:24:58.713
That's not how it is for us.

361
00:24:58.713 --> 00:25:01.738
Who? Who's pushing you out?

362
00:25:01.738 --> 00:25:05.192
Who else? The person at the top.

363
00:25:06.444 --> 00:25:09.285
By "top"...

364
00:25:09.285 --> 00:25:11.760
do you mean the person I'm thinking of?

365
00:25:15.144 --> 00:25:16.605
Do you?

366
00:25:32.563 --> 00:25:34.342
Excuse me.

367
00:25:35.794 --> 00:25:37.984
The CEO is looking for you.

368
00:25:46.521 --> 00:25:50.478
You sold products from a subcontractor
we terminated our contract with?

369
00:25:50.478 --> 00:25:53.566
I've never seen an idiot like you.

370
00:25:54.257 --> 00:25:56.757
What are you doing?
Beg father for forgiveness.

371
00:25:56.757 --> 00:26:00.276
I won't be forgiving you, so get lost.

372
00:26:00.276 --> 00:26:02.239
You're fired starting today.

373
00:26:02.239 --> 00:26:03.865
Drag him out of here now!

374
00:26:03.865 --> 00:26:05.384
Father.

375
00:26:06.722 --> 00:26:08.826
Can you not live this way?

376
00:26:11.074 --> 00:26:13.114
What are you talking about now?

377
00:26:13.114 --> 00:26:15.164
You already have so much.

378
00:26:15.164 --> 00:26:17.712
You should be more than full now.

379
00:26:17.712 --> 00:26:22.172
Can't you share and eat with others now?

380
00:26:22.172 --> 00:26:25.191
There's no such thing
as sharing in this industry.

381
00:26:25.191 --> 00:26:27.341
Don't you know about
survival of the fittest?

382
00:26:27.341 --> 00:26:30.950
If I don't eat it, I'll be eaten.

383
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:32.458
Who do you think you are?

384
00:26:32.458 --> 00:26:35.017
You think you can lecture your father?

385
00:26:35.017 --> 00:26:39.238
Father, it pains me
to hear people curse you.

386
00:26:39.238 --> 00:26:42.376
If you would let go of your greed a bit,
people would like you.

387
00:26:42.376 --> 00:26:44.017
They don't need to like me.

388
00:26:44.017 --> 00:26:46.603
Why does it matter
if they curse me or not?

389
00:26:46.603 --> 00:26:49.942
They're just blaming others
because they have nothing.

390
00:26:49.942 --> 00:26:53.491
What do you know about management
to say that to Father?

391
00:26:53.491 --> 00:26:56.713
Do you think that kind of idea will
help run a big company like this?

392
00:26:56.713 --> 00:26:59.594
Do you know how many employees
he's responsible for?

393
00:26:59.594 --> 00:27:01.913
I know. I know all of that.

394
00:27:01.913 --> 00:27:03.594
Can't you let things slide a little?

395
00:27:03.594 --> 00:27:06.755
Thinking about survival of the fittest
and attacking all the time.

396
00:27:06.755 --> 00:27:10.209
Then once everyone dies,
what do we have left, Woo Sung?

397
00:27:10.209 --> 00:27:11.643
You little punk.

398
00:27:11.643 --> 00:27:16.244
Where did you pick up this stuff
that you're being so insolent?

399
00:27:16.244 --> 00:27:19.664
Hyuk. You're not a leftist, are you?

400
00:27:19.664 --> 00:27:21.184
Have you gone that way?

401
00:27:21.184 --> 00:27:25.203
Father, why are you bringing up
being left wing in our conversation?

402
00:27:25.203 --> 00:27:26.713
It's out of context.

403
00:27:26.713 --> 00:27:28.494
Forget it. Be quiet.

404
00:27:28.494 --> 00:27:32.525
I can't have a son like you
in the company, so just go.

405
00:27:32.525 --> 00:27:34.138
Father!

406
00:27:34.138 --> 00:27:36.389
Isn't anyone out there?

407
00:27:39.463 --> 00:27:42.886
Get this kid out of here now. Right now!

408
00:27:43.413 --> 00:27:45.545
Father, you need to change your mind.

409
00:27:45.545 --> 00:27:48.038
Survival of the fittest is
such an 80s frame of mind.

410
00:27:48.038 --> 00:27:49.652
It's old and not fun!

411
00:27:49.652 --> 00:27:52.518
You piece of crap...

412
00:27:52.518 --> 00:27:54.143
CEO Byun!

413
00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:57.598
CEO, there's big news.

414
00:27:57.598 --> 00:27:59.427
It's the Blue House, Blue House.

415
00:27:59.427 --> 00:28:02.098
Blue? Blue House?

416
00:28:02.098 --> 00:28:03.346
Where's that?

417
00:28:03.346 --> 00:28:04.951
Is it Madam Oh or Madam Hwang?

418
00:28:04.951 --> 00:28:06.699
Not that.

419
00:28:07.321 --> 00:28:09.251
I'm talking about the president.

420
00:28:10.941 --> 00:28:12.126
What?

421
00:28:12.814 --> 00:28:14.235
The Blue House?

422
00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:22.511
Oh, what's going on here?

423
00:28:23.375 --> 00:28:25.163
Ah, ah...

424
00:28:25.163 --> 00:28:27.470
<i>The East Sea...</i>

425
00:28:30.094 --> 00:28:32.863
Yes, this is Byun Gang Su.

426
00:28:39.121 --> 00:28:40.219
What?

427
00:28:40.219 --> 00:28:42.414
Yes, Your Excellency.

428
00:28:44.471 --> 00:28:46.414
I understand, Your Excellency.

429
00:28:46.414 --> 00:28:49.049
How embarrassing.
What's with "Your Excellency"?

430
00:28:49.049 --> 00:28:51.500
He's so old fashioned.

431
00:28:55.023 --> 00:28:57.140
You're the second son's
personal secretary?

432
00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:58.505
Yes.

433
00:28:59.892 --> 00:29:03.981
How could a big company like
Gangsu Foods do something like this?

434
00:29:03.981 --> 00:29:07.577
I am very offended.

435
00:29:08.082 --> 00:29:10.536
I cannot let this go.

436
00:29:10.536 --> 00:29:12.093
I see.

437
00:29:12.093 --> 00:29:15.308
I understand why you are offended.

438
00:29:15.308 --> 00:29:21.323
We are very sorry about
the way this proceeded, as well.

439
00:29:22.746 --> 00:29:26.378
But can you take a look at this?

440
00:29:30.595 --> 00:29:31.650
What is it?

441
00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:36.449
As you can see, the two products
appeal to different age groups.

442
00:29:36.449 --> 00:29:41.842
Those in their 20s to 40s like
your sensible and trendy product.

443
00:29:41.842 --> 00:29:45.979
Those 50 and over like
the beef rice bowl they are used to.

444
00:29:45.979 --> 00:29:50.582
The point is that your
customer base was not taken away.

445
00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:59.101
This occurred because we switched
subcontractors as you requested, Chef.

446
00:29:59.101 --> 00:30:01.253
So, what are you saying?

447
00:30:01.253 --> 00:30:04.798
Are you saying I'm at fault too?

448
00:30:04.798 --> 00:30:07.750
No, I didn't mean that at all.

449
00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:11.206
In the process of
the contract termination

450
00:30:11.206 --> 00:30:15.269
the company broke the custom
of a unilateral contract termination.

451
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:18.210
Gangsu Group made an effort
for both parties to co-exist.

452
00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:21.289
It ended up being leaked to the media.

453
00:30:21.289 --> 00:30:26.095
Our CEO ended up getting a
commendation from the President of Korea.

454
00:30:26.095 --> 00:30:30.130
Huh... what? What did you say?

455
00:30:31.473 --> 00:30:34.486
<i>[Gangsu Group:

456
00:30:36.133 --> 00:30:37.950
<i>[Hiring without a resume]</i>

457
00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.619
<i>[Amazing. Applause for Gangsu Group.]</i>

<i>[Gangsu Group Commendation...]</i>

460
00:30:52.663 --> 00:30:56.069
If you were to file
a lawsuit in this situation...

461
00:30:56.069 --> 00:30:59.238
wouldn't people start saying
you only care about money?

462
00:30:59.238 --> 00:31:01.215
That was my concern.

463
00:31:01.215 --> 00:31:04.241
Ah... I see.

464
00:31:09.653 --> 00:31:14.058
Gangsu Group is considering this
to be a big celebration.

465
00:31:14.058 --> 00:31:17.439
Seman Foods got their contract
extended thanks to you.

466
00:31:18.899 --> 00:31:21.769
It's all thanks to your great article.

467
00:31:23.469 --> 00:31:24.969
Thank you very much.

468
00:31:24.969 --> 00:31:26.458
No need to thank me.

469
00:31:26.458 --> 00:31:29.768
I got a good article out of your tip.

470
00:31:29.768 --> 00:31:31.293
I should be thanking you.

471
00:31:31.293 --> 00:31:34.476
If you have a good source,
please give me a call in the future.

472
00:31:34.477 --> 00:31:35.593
Sure.

473
00:31:36.513 --> 00:31:39.182
Okay. Bye, then.

474
00:31:48.067 --> 00:31:51.194
<i>You have a smart employee
working for you.</i>

475
00:31:52.825 --> 00:31:54.158
Who are you referring to?

476
00:31:54.159 --> 00:31:56.826
The female employee
you sent to persuade me.

477
00:31:56.826 --> 00:31:59.246
She said she was a secretary
for the CEO's second son.

478
00:32:01.136 --> 00:32:04.523
Director Seol,
I will not pursue the lawsuit.

479
00:32:04.523 --> 00:32:08.558
I should partake
in this movement of co-existence.

480
00:32:09.184 --> 00:32:10.373
Bye, now.

481
00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:18.944
- Cheers!
- Good job!

482
00:32:25.968 --> 00:32:29.200

<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

483
00:32:37.569 --> 00:32:39.979
Slow down. No one can get any.

484
00:32:40.516 --> 00:32:43.049
I'm sorry. It's just so good.

485
00:32:43.049 --> 00:32:45.809
What is this anyway?
It's so chewy and tasty.

486
00:32:45.809 --> 00:32:48.162
You've never had pork skin?

487
00:32:48.162 --> 00:32:49.979
Pork skin?

488
00:32:57.969 --> 00:32:59.051
What is it?

489
00:32:59.051 --> 00:33:01.867
Is it hard for you to eat it
now that you know?

490
00:33:01.867 --> 00:33:03.837
How come I didn't know
about this delicious food?

491
00:33:03.837 --> 00:33:06.345
It's not right. I feel betrayed.

492
00:33:07.799 --> 00:33:10.276
I get so shocked when I'm with Hyuk.

493
00:33:10.276 --> 00:33:12.587
The difference in our levels
is so dramatic.

494
00:33:12.587 --> 00:33:16.610
Rather than being the son of a rich
household who never tried pork skin

495
00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:19.638
my life is much better
since I've had lots of pork skin!

496
00:33:21.951 --> 00:33:24.676
Anyway, thank you.

497
00:33:24.676 --> 00:33:26.436
You saved me.

498
00:33:27.848 --> 00:33:29.381
Thank you to you too, young lady.

499
00:33:29.381 --> 00:33:30.661
It's nothing.

500
00:33:31.332 --> 00:33:33.461
It's all thanks to Mister Kim.

501
00:33:33.461 --> 00:33:34.968
Yes, that's very true!

502
00:33:34.968 --> 00:33:37.720
Oh no. What did I do?

503
00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:40.534
You did a lot.

504
00:33:41.157 --> 00:33:45.382
Everyone, thank you to all of you.

505
00:33:47.325 --> 00:33:48.546
Thank you.

506
00:33:50.016 --> 00:33:53.727
Let's do a toast, everyone.

507
00:33:53.727 --> 00:33:56.222
Success to Gangsu's beef rice bowl!

508
00:33:56.222 --> 00:33:59.850
- Success!
- Cheers!

509
00:34:04.537 --> 00:34:05.745
So delicious.

510
00:34:05.745 --> 00:34:08.004
- Is it that good?
- Yes, it is.

511
00:34:10.658 --> 00:34:13.576
Slow down. No one's
going to take it from you.

512
00:34:13.576 --> 00:34:14.984
It's hot.

513
00:34:17.312 --> 00:34:19.513
Ah... this is nice.

514
00:34:19.513 --> 00:34:20.973
I'm so full.

515
00:34:22.995 --> 00:34:24.776
I really like pork skin.

516
00:34:24.776 --> 00:34:26.944
How could that be
your first time trying it?

517
00:34:50.352 --> 00:34:51.792
It's cold.

518
00:34:51.792 --> 00:34:52.922
Yeah.

519
00:34:53.906 --> 00:34:56.036
You should be honest and admit it.

520
00:34:56.038 --> 00:34:57.167
What?

521
00:34:57.167 --> 00:34:59.437
Why do you continue to deny it, Joon?

522
00:34:59.437 --> 00:35:02.352
Open your heart and accept your feelings.

523
00:35:02.352 --> 00:35:06.299
If I felt two million volts,
you must've felt at least one million.

524
00:35:06.299 --> 00:35:09.629
How can we be friends?
No, we're meant to be.

525
00:35:09.629 --> 00:35:11.698
Don't deny fate, Joon.

526
00:35:22.928 --> 00:35:24.928
<i>Let me ask you something.</i>

527
00:35:24.928 --> 00:35:27.138
Why are you by Byun Hyuk's side?

528
00:35:27.138 --> 00:35:30.759
Why not just come work
as an intern instead?

529
00:35:34.169 --> 00:35:35.877
I want to change things.

530
00:35:38.207 --> 00:35:42.156
In order to change things
as an employee of Gangsu Group

531
00:35:42.156 --> 00:35:44.350
I would have to be an executive,
at the very least.

532
00:35:45.328 --> 00:35:48.328
What do you think
the chances of that are?

533
00:35:50.417 --> 00:35:55.254
Suppose I'm very talented
and I do become an executive.

534
00:35:55.254 --> 00:35:57.138
How many years would that take?

535
00:35:57.888 --> 00:36:01.864
10 years, 15 years, or maybe 20?

536
00:36:02.468 --> 00:36:05.997
Once I get through
the difficulties to get up there...

537
00:36:05.997 --> 00:36:11.308
do you think I will still maintain the
mindset of wanting to change things?

538
00:36:14.018 --> 00:36:16.210
With Hyuk, it's possible.

539
00:36:17.495 --> 00:36:21.370
If Hyuk changes his mind,
Gangsu Group changes.

540
00:36:22.477 --> 00:36:24.399
You saw it too.

541
00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:31.344
<i>Don't think that I changed Hyuk.</i>

542
00:36:32.332 --> 00:36:36.772
<i>Watching Hyuk change
is what changed the way I think.</i>

543
00:36:36.772 --> 00:36:39.297
So, change the way you think.

544
00:36:39.297 --> 00:36:43.093
Even if you insist it's friendship,
you cannot hide true love.

545
00:36:43.093 --> 00:36:46.321
You will eventually
have to accept our fate.

546
00:36:47.459 --> 00:36:49.361
- Oh, it's a rat.
- A rat?

547
00:36:49.361 --> 00:36:52.694
Rat? Rat, rat, rat?

548
00:36:52.694 --> 00:36:55.062
- Rat, rat, rat!
- What do we do?

549
00:36:55.062 --> 00:36:56.455
- It's a rat, a rat.
- Oh no.

550
00:36:56.455 --> 00:36:59.502
- Oh, it's so big. What do we do?
- Rat!

551
00:36:59.502 --> 00:37:01.582
A rat, a rat...

552
00:37:04.132 --> 00:37:06.656
Seriously? That's not fair, Joon.

553
00:37:06.656 --> 00:37:07.893
What did I do?

554
00:37:07.893 --> 00:37:10.609
A rat is out of line.

555
00:37:10.609 --> 00:37:11.926
A rat?

556
00:37:11.926 --> 00:37:13.268
<i>So, Hyuk...</i>

557
00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:16.935
<i>I'm going to take some time
and let things play out.</i>

558
00:37:17.906 --> 00:37:20.268
<i>Why did we end up meeting like this?</i>

559
00:37:21.205 --> 00:37:26.140
<i>If we met because of fate like you said,
then what's the reason?</i>

560
00:37:28.546 --> 00:37:32.617
Even a clumsy cow can catch a mouse,
but it should know its place.

561
00:37:32.617 --> 00:37:37.088
First, the direct hiring of cleaners,
and now this subcontractor issue.

562
00:37:37.088 --> 00:37:40.452
A commendation honor from the president
because of Hyuk's trouble-making?

563
00:37:43.905 --> 00:37:46.383
Isn't the world so unfair?

564
00:37:50.416 --> 00:37:55.302
<i>Yes, the world has always been unfair.</i>

565
00:37:58.892 --> 00:38:00.200
Oh, are you home?

566
00:38:00.584 --> 00:38:01.686
What brings you by?

567
00:38:01.686 --> 00:38:03.990
These are clothes for Young Master.

568
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:07.113
His mother sent some
food for him, as well.

569
00:38:09.566 --> 00:38:11.048
You should eat some too.

570
00:38:15.912 --> 00:38:18.506
Are the floors heated?

571
00:38:19.336 --> 00:38:21.256
Does it get drafty?

572
00:38:23.508 --> 00:38:25.140
Oh my.

573
00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:28.452
It must get uncomfortable
with only one bed.

574
00:38:28.452 --> 00:38:31.865
You ought to let Young Master
sleep on the bed if you can.

575
00:38:31.865 --> 00:38:35.233
Dad, do you know how many years
it's been since you've visited?

576
00:38:35.233 --> 00:38:38.936
All you can say when you do come
is how concerned you are about Hyuk?

577
00:38:38.936 --> 00:38:41.970
You're good at everything,
so I don't worry about you.

578
00:38:41.970 --> 00:38:43.655
Yet, you worry about Hyuk?

579
00:38:43.655 --> 00:38:45.155
Of course, I worry.

580
00:38:45.155 --> 00:38:49.186
He was in a house that was like a palace,
so it must be very hard for him here.

581
00:38:52.548 --> 00:38:55.526
Uh... hold on.

582
00:39:00.905 --> 00:39:03.852
I did slip upstairs a little.

583
00:39:04.483 --> 00:39:07.260
The lights were off on the roof.

584
00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:08.780
Why do you care about the roof?

585
00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:13.713
Hyuk's mother wants me to
look into what kind of girl she is.

586
00:39:14.505 --> 00:39:15.961
Even his mother?

587
00:39:16.481 --> 00:39:19.660
Why is the whole family
so interested in Joon?

588
00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:22.901
She really likes
that young lady very much.

589
00:39:22.901 --> 00:39:25.664
The young master has started
to get it together since he met her.

590
00:39:25.664 --> 00:39:27.467
She thinks things are working out well.

591
00:39:28.041 --> 00:39:29.242
So, what?

592
00:39:29.242 --> 00:39:33.363
Is that great household going to bring
a girl like Joon into the family?

593
00:39:33.363 --> 00:39:35.423
I was very surprised too.

594
00:39:36.291 --> 00:39:39.651
She told me to see
how far along their relationship is.

595
00:39:40.262 --> 00:39:43.300
It seems she is considering her
as a spouse for Hyuk.

596
00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:45.878
- What?
- That's why I'm asking...

597
00:39:45.878 --> 00:39:48.106
Do you know anything?

598
00:39:48.106 --> 00:39:50.240
How far have they progressed?

599
00:39:52.909 --> 00:39:55.334
What? Do you not know?

600
00:39:55.334 --> 00:39:56.443
Father.

601
00:39:57.934 --> 00:39:59.914
Are you happy living this way?

602
00:40:01.514 --> 00:40:05.126
You know everything about them
and now even look into women.

603
00:40:05.126 --> 00:40:07.718
You've done all their menial chores.

604
00:40:07.718 --> 00:40:09.626
Have you never regretted it?

605
00:40:13.044 --> 00:40:16.738
I really don't know,
and that's why I'm asking.

606
00:40:17.273 --> 00:40:19.247
Tell me honestly just once.

607
00:40:21.414 --> 00:40:25.338
No, I have never regretted it.

608
00:40:26.088 --> 00:40:30.698
How could a person like me ever
work for a person like CEO Byun?

609
00:40:32.171 --> 00:40:35.017
He has given me everything.

610
00:40:35.017 --> 00:40:36.887
Even after suffering that disgrace?

611
00:40:44.305 --> 00:40:45.974
Don't worry.

612
00:40:45.974 --> 00:40:48.918
CEO Byun said
he'd take care of everything.

613
00:40:49.457 --> 00:40:52.959
You just need to study hard, okay?

614
00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:59.180
Jae Hoon, look at my face just once.

615
00:41:08.735 --> 00:41:11.093
I was able to raise you this way,
thanks to that.

616
00:41:11.093 --> 00:41:13.610
You're saying you
sacrificed yourself for me...

617
00:41:14.932 --> 00:41:16.452
It makes me feel awful.

618
00:41:16.452 --> 00:41:19.206
I'm also sick and tired of it.

619
00:41:21.122 --> 00:41:22.309
So...

620
00:41:23.097 --> 00:41:26.858
Do you want me to
live my life forever like you?

621
00:41:35.639 --> 00:41:36.898
All right.

622
00:41:40.137 --> 00:41:41.381
Father.

623
00:41:41.381 --> 00:41:43.079
Eat well and stay healthy.

624
00:41:43.079 --> 00:41:46.079
- Be good until I come back.
- Father!

625
00:41:46.483 --> 00:41:48.693
- Father!
- Go on in.

626
00:41:48.693 --> 00:41:50.302
- Let go! Father.
- Don't worry.

627
00:41:50.724 --> 00:41:52.012
No!

628
00:42:07.526 --> 00:42:08.631
Father...

629
00:42:12.552 --> 00:42:14.256
Father!

630
00:42:35.005 --> 00:42:36.102
Father.

631
00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:41.144
Father, I...

632
00:42:43.447 --> 00:42:45.278
I'm having a very hard time.

633
00:42:46.059 --> 00:42:47.548
It's very hard for me.

634
00:43:26.843 --> 00:43:30.186
<i>No! I will go.</i>

635
00:43:31.097 --> 00:43:33.941
I said I'd take responsibility for it.

636
00:43:33.941 --> 00:43:36.126
Why would you send him?

637
00:43:36.126 --> 00:43:39.709
Open the door, please! Mister!

638
00:43:40.064 --> 00:43:41.461
<i>Mister!</i>

639
00:43:45.409 --> 00:43:47.758
<i>Open the door.</i>

640
00:43:48.751 --> 00:43:50.102
<i>Mister!</i>

641
00:44:38.445 --> 00:44:43.416
A coworker was retiring that day
and we were drinking a lot.

642
00:44:43.416 --> 00:44:45.057
It was the alcohol.

643
00:44:45.057 --> 00:44:48.947
You didn't think
I spent the night there, did you?

644
00:44:48.947 --> 00:44:50.635
No, I wasn't thinking anything.

645
00:44:50.635 --> 00:44:51.968
Don't worry.

646
00:44:53.488 --> 00:44:54.981
For real, right?

647
00:44:54.981 --> 00:44:58.706
Third Generation and that guy...
Kwon Jae Hoon too?

648
00:44:58.706 --> 00:45:00.776
I told you not to worry.

649
00:45:00.776 --> 00:45:02.416
Just forget about it.

650
00:45:04.816 --> 00:45:05.957
I should.

651
00:45:06.698 --> 00:45:08.273
It keeps bothering me.

652
00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:10.280
I keep thinking about it.

653
00:45:12.626 --> 00:45:13.680
Joon.

654
00:45:15.108 --> 00:45:19.427
A guy did a mean thing to me,
but I keep thinking about him.

655
00:45:19.883 --> 00:45:23.421
What, exactly, is this feeling?

656
00:45:26.213 --> 00:45:28.548
What kind of thoughts are you having?

657
00:45:29.867 --> 00:45:34.287
I just... thought he was a jerk.

658
00:45:36.102 --> 00:45:40.407
My heart aches when I think about him.

659
00:45:41.258 --> 00:45:42.669
Since when?

660
00:45:42.669 --> 00:45:46.249
Since I saw him sleeping.

661
00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:06.651
What should I do, Joon?

662
00:46:14.916 --> 00:46:16.686
<i>[Certificate of Honor]</i>

663
00:46:17.814 --> 00:46:21.309
Goodness, a certificate
from the Blue House.

664
00:46:21.309 --> 00:46:24.287
Of all the things to happen in my life.

665
00:46:25.717 --> 00:46:28.314
Congratulations, Honey.

666
00:46:28.314 --> 00:46:32.084
This is so nice having
a meal together, thanks to Hyuk.

667
00:46:32.798 --> 00:46:34.148
Good job, Hyuk.

668
00:46:34.148 --> 00:46:35.885
I'm happy since you're happy, Mom.

669
00:46:36.941 --> 00:46:40.829
I always knew you'd do well.

670
00:46:40.829 --> 00:46:43.639
I'm the one who carried Hyuk
on my back and raised him.

671
00:46:43.639 --> 00:46:47.653
Please remember that this wouldn't
have happened without me.

672
00:46:49.307 --> 00:46:52.048
When was it that you were berating him?

673
00:46:53.461 --> 00:46:57.889
Hyuk seems to be helping out
Father well, so I'm proud of him.

674
00:46:59.055 --> 00:47:00.320
Yes.

675
00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:03.738
What do I now?

676
00:47:03.738 --> 00:47:05.548
I was never really interested in it.

677
00:47:05.548 --> 00:47:09.706
However, I do have a friend
who's always teaching me things.

678
00:47:09.706 --> 00:47:12.878
Friend? Who is it?

679
00:47:12.878 --> 00:47:15.691
You saw her before, Father.
Her name is Baek Joon.

680
00:47:17.121 --> 00:47:19.454
That young lady who cleans?

681
00:47:19.454 --> 00:47:23.278
Yes, she has a lot of experience in life
and knows so much.

682
00:47:23.867 --> 00:47:27.122
I am always learning a lot through Joon.

683
00:47:27.858 --> 00:47:30.005
Mom, is she Pyunggang?

684
00:47:31.246 --> 00:47:33.389
Pyunggang?
What do you mean, Pyunggang?

685
00:47:33.389 --> 00:47:34.615
What does that mean?

686
00:47:34.615 --> 00:47:36.084
It's nothing.

687
00:47:38.273 --> 00:47:39.352
Honey.

688
00:47:39.968 --> 00:47:43.793
It seems that
Monk Chung Woong is correct.

689
00:47:45.573 --> 00:47:48.256
Why? What did Monk Chung Woong say?

690
00:47:48.256 --> 00:47:51.354
He said our Hyuk will
accomplish something big.

691
00:47:51.354 --> 00:47:54.119
He even compared him to Steve Jobs.

692
00:47:54.119 --> 00:47:58.334
Byun Hyuk, just like his name,
could be a revolutionary icon.

693
00:47:58.334 --> 00:48:00.434
Oh, really?

694
00:48:01.782 --> 00:48:05.793
Well, we'll have to
wait and see about that.

695
00:48:05.793 --> 00:48:09.898
Will he become Jobs
or a person who can't do anything?

696
00:48:11.791 --> 00:48:12.916
Hey.

697
00:48:14.037 --> 00:48:18.173
I'll give you a reward,
so tell me if you want something.

698
00:48:18.173 --> 00:48:19.238
A reward?

699
00:48:20.166 --> 00:48:21.753
Yes, Gang Su!

700
00:48:21.753 --> 00:48:25.240
Give him something good
while you're at it.

701
00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:30.124
Our stock prices have
gone up a lot thanks to Hyuk.

702
00:48:30.124 --> 00:48:33.182
Yes, give him something big.

703
00:48:33.182 --> 00:48:35.235
I'll treat him well with this.

704
00:48:35.235 --> 00:48:37.659
- Gang Su!
- Come on.

705
00:49:00.961 --> 00:49:02.244
<i>Woo Sung.</i>

706
00:49:02.244 --> 00:49:05.932
You've met that girl Baek Joon
who Hyuk's talking about, right?

707
00:49:06.811 --> 00:49:08.305
What do you think about her?

708
00:49:08.305 --> 00:49:10.180
Why are you suddenly interested in her?

709
00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:12.273
Apparently, she's the Pyunggang to Hyuk.

710
00:49:12.273 --> 00:49:15.280
She's like his lucky talisman who helps--

711
00:49:17.823 --> 00:49:22.702
Whatever the case,
she's helping Hyuk a lot now.

712
00:49:22.702 --> 00:49:25.852
I want to know who she is,
like her family and background.

713
00:49:25.852 --> 00:49:29.104
I thought I should know these things.

714
00:49:39.814 --> 00:49:41.015
Baek Joon?

715
00:49:44.981 --> 00:49:46.651
Can you come see me?

716
00:49:46.651 --> 00:49:48.427
Yes, Chief Byun.

717
00:49:53.037 --> 00:49:54.718
What? My brother?

718
00:49:54.718 --> 00:49:57.115
Yes, he just called her into his office.

719
00:49:57.677 --> 00:50:02.044
Why would he need to talk to Joon?

720
00:50:02.044 --> 00:50:03.592
You don't know, do you?

721
00:50:04.195 --> 00:50:06.222
Don't worry. I'll look into it.

722
00:50:06.222 --> 00:50:08.492
Oh, okay.

723
00:50:08.492 --> 00:50:09.639
He doesn't know?

724
00:50:10.650 --> 00:50:11.997
He doesn't seem to know.

725
00:50:27.992 --> 00:50:29.579
What is this about?

726
00:50:30.778 --> 00:50:35.555
Miss Baek Joon, why did you
approach my brother, Hyuk?

727
00:50:35.555 --> 00:50:37.271
Excuse me?

728
00:50:41.099 --> 00:50:44.213
You're with him
in order to manipulate him.

729
00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:46.414
What's the reason?

730
00:50:47.329 --> 00:50:49.200
What are you talking about?

731
00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:50.628
Baek Sung Ki?

732
00:50:52.325 --> 00:50:53.914
Is it about your father?

733
00:51:00.034 --> 00:51:03.236
I don't know how we,
as brothers, might look to you.

734
00:51:04.809 --> 00:51:06.443
Hyuk is my little brother.

735
00:51:07.974 --> 00:51:10.323
I am his one and only brother.

736
00:51:11.564 --> 00:51:14.921
No matter how much
I might not like what he's doing

737
00:51:14.921 --> 00:51:17.227
I will always be on his side.

738
00:51:17.227 --> 00:51:21.220
Blood runs thicker than
what you have with him.

739
00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:24.463
I don't understand what your point is.

740
00:51:25.901 --> 00:51:27.825
Your father, Baek Sung Ki.

741
00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:31.110
He worked in Strategic Planning
before he left.

742
00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:32.436
What about it?

743
00:51:32.436 --> 00:51:34.566
Is something wrong with that?

744
00:51:34.566 --> 00:51:36.555
Do you know why he left the company?

745
00:51:36.555 --> 00:51:39.657
I know he was forced into retirement
and it was a wrongful dismissal.

746
00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:44.427
Your father took bribes and was fired.

747
00:51:46.173 --> 00:51:48.822
You're the daughter of an employee
who was bribed and fired.

748
00:51:48.822 --> 00:51:51.360
It's bad enough that you work here.

749
00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:53.997
Now, you're hanging around
my younger brother.

750
00:51:56.097 --> 00:51:58.610
How am I supposed to
interpret all of this?

751
00:52:00.157 --> 00:52:01.323
Bribery?

752
00:52:02.934 --> 00:52:04.380
That's ridiculous!

753
00:52:08.816 --> 00:52:10.226
I'll ask you one more time.

754
00:52:10.785 --> 00:52:13.099
What's your motive for being with Hyuk?

755
00:52:15.358 --> 00:52:18.747
What are you planning to do
by manipulating Hyuk?

756
00:52:30.553 --> 00:52:31.564
You...

757
00:52:32.586 --> 00:52:35.503
Get away from my brother
while I'm still being nice about it.

758
00:52:36.876 --> 00:52:38.624
Otherwise, things will get really bad.

759
00:52:40.796 --> 00:52:41.965
Got it?

760
00:53:19.943 --> 00:53:21.604
Did Chief Byun put you up to it?

761
00:53:22.557 --> 00:53:24.365
Is that why you
looked into my background?

762
00:53:25.097 --> 00:53:27.602
That's why I asked you
to stay away from Hyuk.

763
00:53:27.602 --> 00:53:30.374
Why did you make things this way
by not listening to me?

764
00:53:30.374 --> 00:53:31.726
Tell me.

765
00:53:33.135 --> 00:53:34.541
It's a lie, right?

766
00:53:34.541 --> 00:53:37.160
The fact that my dad
got fired for bribery.

767
00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:39.242
He made it all up, right?

768
00:53:40.017 --> 00:53:42.115
Why does it matter if it's true or not?

769
00:53:42.865 --> 00:53:46.434
Chief Byun is telling you
to get away from Hyuk.

770
00:53:46.434 --> 00:53:47.515
No.

771
00:53:48.787 --> 00:53:52.039
You don't know
how important this is to me.

772
00:53:52.894 --> 00:53:57.349
I thought that my dad got kicked out of
the company when he did nothing wrong.

773
00:53:57.349 --> 00:54:02.780
That's why I made the decision not to
work full-time for any company.

774
00:54:04.452 --> 00:54:06.006
But what if that's not true?

775
00:54:08.546 --> 00:54:12.280
What if I've lived my life
the wrong way all this time?

776
00:54:14.224 --> 00:54:15.863
I need to know.

777
00:54:19.023 --> 00:54:20.157
So, tell me.

778
00:54:22.289 --> 00:54:26.546
Was my dad really... fired for bribery?

779
00:54:27.559 --> 00:54:28.606
Is that right?

780
00:54:30.706 --> 00:54:32.166
It's not true, Jae Hoon. Right?

781
00:54:34.155 --> 00:54:36.869
He's right. It's true.

782
00:54:46.285 --> 00:54:47.869
It makes no sense.

783
00:54:49.285 --> 00:54:53.151
No... my dad would never.

784
00:54:59.068 --> 00:55:00.305
See for yourself.

00:56:55.843 --> 00:56:58.162
We're just salespeople.

802
00:56:59.191 --> 00:57:02.191
We inherited Grandfather's
soy sauce business.

803
00:57:02.191 --> 00:57:05.080
We sold soy bean paste and
red chili paste to get here.

804
00:57:06.272 --> 00:57:11.537
Is that so great that we should have
such incompetent privilege?

805
00:57:11.537 --> 00:57:14.222
What? Incompetent?

806
00:57:14.222 --> 00:57:18.298
Our aunt and uncle fight daily in
order to get more for themselves.

807
00:57:19.013 --> 00:57:22.492
There's our father,
who uses violence to get power.

808
00:57:23.361 --> 00:57:27.314
Why are you so proud of
a household like that, Woo Sung?

809
00:57:27.314 --> 00:57:30.115
Leave if you don't like
a family like that.

810
00:57:31.327 --> 00:57:34.591
Don't make people worry by being
an intern when you're not good at it.

811
00:57:41.687 --> 00:57:45.171
The world is a small place.

812
00:57:46.617 --> 00:57:50.425
You're really
Manager Baek Sung Ki's daughter?

813
00:57:54.325 --> 00:57:55.406
Yes.

814
00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:05.216
You told me.

815
00:58:06.169 --> 00:58:09.390
You said my father was a good man.

816
00:58:10.122 --> 00:58:13.386
Yes, I did say that.

817
00:58:15.098 --> 00:58:17.894
I thought about it a lot
and it was strange.

818
00:58:18.665 --> 00:58:23.254
Most people wouldn't recall people
who took bribes as good.

819
00:58:26.580 --> 00:58:30.408
I just saw the record of
your testimony, President Jang.

820
00:58:31.615 --> 00:58:38.044
Did my dad really request bribes
from you like you testified?

821
00:58:38.176 --> 00:58:39.598
Did he threaten you?

822
00:58:42.656 --> 00:58:46.316
Please tell me.
I want to know the truth.

823
00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:51.363
I don't remember that incident.

824
00:58:53.341 --> 00:58:54.899
You do remember it.

825
00:58:55.803 --> 00:58:59.841
You even spoke about my father when
you didn't know I was his daughter.

826
00:58:59.841 --> 00:59:02.481
That means you still remember.

827
00:59:03.180 --> 00:59:06.370
Why would you bring that up now?
It's not a good memory.

828
00:59:06.370 --> 00:59:08.091
It's important to me.

829
00:59:08.651 --> 00:59:10.482
My life depends on it.

830
00:59:11.772 --> 00:59:15.377
Please... tell me.

831
00:59:19.372 --> 00:59:22.925
It's true. It's just as I testified.

832
00:59:22.925 --> 00:59:26.658
I gave Manager Baek bribes
just as I testified.

833
00:59:28.231 --> 00:59:30.171
That was the procedure back then.

834
00:59:30.830 --> 00:59:34.691
Subcontractors back then
gave away their organs.

835
00:59:35.274 --> 00:59:38.022
It doesn't seem much different now.

836
00:59:46.631 --> 00:59:48.495
President Jang.

837
00:59:49.752 --> 00:59:52.624
Please... Please don't lie.

838
00:59:53.044 --> 00:59:55.633
You said Manager Baek was different.

839
00:59:55.633 --> 00:59:59.745
You said so yourself that
my dad was a good man.

840
00:59:59.745 --> 01:00:02.533
President, President.

841
01:00:04.883 --> 01:00:06.926
Don't ask me any more.

842
01:00:07.584 --> 01:00:09.778
This is all I can say.

843
01:00:09.778 --> 01:00:12.314
Wait, President. President...

844
01:00:27.232 --> 01:00:29.602
<i>You worked so hard for Gangsu Group.</i>

845
01:00:29.602 --> 01:00:32.037
<i>You devoted your youth to them!</i>

846
01:00:32.037 --> 01:00:34.303
They worked you night and day.

847
01:00:34.303 --> 01:00:37.452
How could they kick you out
overnight like this?

848
01:00:39.263 --> 01:00:40.604
That's enough.

849
01:00:42.318 --> 01:00:44.745
It's hard for me too.

850
01:00:44.745 --> 01:00:46.542
How could they do this?

851
01:00:46.542 --> 01:00:49.008
How could they do this?

852
01:00:49.008 --> 01:00:53.200
You were so wronged.
How could they do this?

853
01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:55.432
Don't you feel so wronged?

854
01:01:31.448 --> 01:01:33.062
What are you doing, Dad?

855
01:01:38.756 --> 01:01:40.801
I said what are you doing, Dad!

856
01:02:03.298 --> 01:02:04.492
You weren't sleeping?

857
01:02:07.222 --> 01:02:08.709
Why did you come out?

858
01:02:15.173 --> 01:02:16.510
I'm hungry.

859
01:02:18.836 --> 01:02:19.986
Huh?

860
01:02:21.646 --> 01:02:23.689
I said I'm hungry, Dad.

861
01:02:55.367 --> 01:02:58.734
<i>Miss Baek Joon,
why did you approach my brother, Hyuk?</i>

862
01:02:59.521 --> 01:03:02.296
What's your motive for being with Hyuk?

863
01:03:03.223 --> 01:03:06.131
What are you planning to do
by manipulating Hyuk?

864
01:03:10.068 --> 01:03:11.508
I'm hungry.

865
01:03:12.906 --> 01:03:13.968
Huh?

866
01:03:15.075 --> 01:03:16.783
I said I'm hungry.

867
01:03:52.278 --> 01:03:53.604
What are you doing?

868
01:03:55.095 --> 01:03:56.236
Eat up.

869
01:03:58.267 --> 01:03:59.352
Okay.

870
01:04:01.492 --> 01:04:02.863
Ta-da.

871
01:04:35.731 --> 01:04:37.598
What are you doing? Eat up.

872
01:04:45.044 --> 01:04:46.135
Joon.

873
01:04:47.388 --> 01:04:52.357
Do you know what the best ramen
I ever had in my life was?

874
01:04:55.126 --> 01:05:00.216
It was the ramen you made for me
on the day we first met.

875
01:05:01.517 --> 01:05:05.551
Back then, I thought
it was because I was hungry.

876
01:05:05.551 --> 01:05:07.102
That wasn't it, though.

877
01:05:07.658 --> 01:05:09.294
It was because it was you.

878
01:05:11.162 --> 01:05:13.624
It was because I ate it with you.

879
01:05:16.307 --> 01:05:20.694
For me, the ramen I eat with you...

880
01:05:21.437 --> 01:05:23.463
tastes the best to me in the world.

881
01:05:26.910 --> 01:05:28.100
I'm going to eat now.

882
01:05:33.618 --> 01:05:36.386
That's good.

883
01:06:59.906 --> 01:07:01.231
<i>So, Hyuk...</i>

884
01:07:02.343 --> 01:07:04.798
<i>I'm going to take some time
and let things play out.</i>

885
01:07:05.857 --> 01:07:08.263
<i>Why did we end up meeting like this?</i>

886
01:07:09.122 --> 01:07:14.584
<i>If we met because of fate like you said,
then what's the reason?</i>

887
01:07:49.323 --> 01:07:56.323

<i>You're hiding something, right?</i>

893
