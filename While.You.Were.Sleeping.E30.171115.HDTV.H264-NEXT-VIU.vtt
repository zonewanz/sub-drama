(Korea's First Artificial Intelligence Cancer Center)

2
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.109
Being discharged isn't a big deal.

3
00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.080
You didn't have to come.

4
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.580
I know, right? I'm not a kid.

5
00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:15.580
You're not a kid, but you're an important witness.

6
00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:17.689
I contacted the police and requested protective custody.

7
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.389
You requested protective custody?

8
00:00:19.389 --> 00:00:21.459
Nothing will happen, but just in case.

9
00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:23.459
What if Yu Beom is out to get her?

10
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.730
Does that mean you'll follow me around until the trial is over?

11
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.600
That's right. Just hang in there for a few days.

12
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.730
The trial will happen soon.

13
00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:34.300
Oh, there they are.

14
00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:42.280
Hello.

15
00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:44.510
- What? - We're here...

16
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.050
to protect Ms. Nam Hong Joo. I'm Han Woo Tak...

17
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.949
- from Sangku Division. - And I'm Lieutenant Oh Kyung Han.

18
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.790
We'll keep you safe until the trial is over.

19
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:54.689
Woo Tak.

20
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.929
I'm glad that it'll be done by officers we know.

21
00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.399
Are you all right? I've been really worried about you.

22
00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:01.659
Yes, I'm fine.

23
00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.929
Jae Chan told me...

24
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
that you went out of your way to rescue me.

25
00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:07.669
Well, he didn't make that much effort.

26
00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.109
Woo Tak, are you the only police officer in the entire Hangang-gu?

27
00:01:11.209 --> 00:01:14.310
Right? I was also very surprised when I was assigned to this.

28
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:15.909
What a coincidence.

29
00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:20.119
Coincidence, my foot. What on earth are you talking about?

30
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.490
It has to be one or the other.

31
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.320
Either Prosecutor Jung requested us,

32
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.560
or Lieutenant Han volunteered.

33
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.790
I never put in such a request.

34
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.030
I didn't volunteer either.

35
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.399
One of you is obviously putting on a show now...

36
00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:36.469
to fool all of us, but I'm...

37
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.129
not even interested, so let's get going.

38
00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:40.770
Thank you.

39
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.869
Come on. Let's go.

40
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.010
Don't put on such a show.

41
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.109
Gosh, look who's talking.

42
00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:48.709
Drive safely.

43
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.790
Let's order dinner from Dongchunwon.

44
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.459
And double-check this seized items list.

45
00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:05.459
Sure.

46
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.159
Dongchunwon is closed on Sundays. Shall I boil water for cup noodles?

47
00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:09.570
It's okay. I'll do it.

48
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:11.929
Shall I boil water for yours too?

49
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.300
Yes, please. I want the kimchi flavor.

50
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.310
How can you be so calm?

51
00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:23.980
What do you mean?

52
00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.879
Ms. Nam nearly died.

53
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.719
Had I been in your situation,

54
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.689
I would've grabbed Lee Yu Beom by the collar at the very least.

55
00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:32.090
Do I seem calm to you?

56
00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:34.159
Yes, you're starting to scare me a little.

57
00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:35.659
I'm not calm at all.

58
00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:37.490
I'm furious.

59
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.869
Lee Yu Beom! Let go!

60
00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:48.040
Every second, I imagine grabbing him by the collar,

61
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.609
yelling, and beating him to a pulp.

62
00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:50.939
And?

63
00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:52.879
- Hey, enough. - Sir!

64
00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.609
I said, stop it!

65
00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.409
- But the consequences of that... - Hey!

66
00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:57.510
- will be too cruel. - Are you out of your mind?

67
00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.820
- I'll be excluded from everything. - Take your hands off it now!

68
00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:01.550
I won't be able to do anything.

69
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:02.550
Are you a thug or what?

70
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.790
- What will you do now? - I'll have to accept it,

71
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.149
and I'll also receive a restraining order.

72
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.990
Everything will be ruined.

73
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.389
So is that why you're suppressing your anger?

74
00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:16.030
That's right. My jaw hurts every morning...

75
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:17.600
because I clench my teeth so hard at night.

76
00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:20.070
I have a mouthguard. Shall I lend it to you?

77
00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:21.369
You'll find it helpful.

78
00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:23.109
Gosh, you should've told me sooner.

79
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.169
Please bring it tomorrow.

80
00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:29.050
All right, I will.

81
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.280
It looks like you think that everything I own is yours anyway.

82
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.750
I shall bring Red as well as my mouthguard for you.

83
00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.320
(Vecaron, 3 vials)

84
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.790
Whose handwriting is this?

85
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:42.929
It's mine.

86
00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:46.129
Would you mind reading what's written here aloud?

87
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.859
I'm farsighted due to my old age.

88
00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:50.800
You absolutely can't make any mistakes. Got it?

89
00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.199
Mr. Han, why can't you tell us the color of the umbrella?

90
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.869
What color was the umbrella?

91
00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:57.869
I can't really differentiate colors.

92
00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:19.929
What should I do now, Robin?

93
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.169
It looks like I'll ruin everything.

94
00:04:31.109 --> 00:04:32.510
Gosh, relax.

95
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.909
Today, we'll just go through the evidence lists.

96
00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.550
There's Mr. Eight-figure Salary. At 3 o'clock.

97
00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:44.819
Prosecutor Lee Ji Kwang, I've heard a lot about you.

98
00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:48.219
Please go easy on us, Prosecutor Jung.

99
00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:50.759
That's what we want to ask you.

100
00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:52.529
Mr. Eight... I mean, Mr. Ko.

101
00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:55.500
I reviewed your evidence list.

102
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.469
You sure have investigated everything thoroughly.

103
00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:58.500
Oh, you think so?

104
00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:01.170
Then please don't disagree with too many of them.

105
00:05:01.239 --> 00:05:02.869
It'll complicate things for both sides, you know.

106
00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:06.409
I know that, of course. I hate dealing with delays in trials.

107
00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.119
(Trial in Session)

108
00:05:16.119 --> 00:05:19.020
Counsel, would you like to let us know your thoughts on the evidence?

109
00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:23.330
Sure. Evidence number three, disagree.

110
00:05:23.989 --> 00:05:26.900
We also disagree with number 7 and 11.

111
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.830
He said he won't disagree with anything.

112
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.029
- Number 13, disagree. - Just disagree with all of them.

113
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.600
We were going to disagree with number 15 as well,

114
00:05:34.239 --> 00:05:35.339
but we'll let this one slide.

115
00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:37.569
Goodness, thank you so very much.

116
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.480
Number 17, disagree.

117
00:05:40.679 --> 00:05:43.779
Number 17 is the victim Nam Hong Joo's statement.

118
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.210
You don't agree with it?

119
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.750
No, Ms. Nam is the only witness in this case.

120
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.650
Her statement will decide whether the defendant is guilty or not,

121
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.619
so I think that we must have her testify...

122
00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:56.259
right here in the courtroom to determine her credibility.

123
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.360
Okay, point taken.

124
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:02.799
Is there anything else you'd like to point out?

125
00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:04.670
Yes, there are still many on our list.

126
00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:06.540
Number 19, disagree.

127
00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:09.270
What's his problem? Why is he questioning Mr. Choi's credibility?

128
00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:11.670
Will we have to summon Mr. Choi Dam Dong as well?

129
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.480
Yes. The prosecution is insisting...

130
00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.710
that the defendant killed Ms. Ha Ju Won in order to conceal...

131
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.549
that he tampered with evidence...

132
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.279
while working on the IV drip serial murder case in the past.

133
00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:23.389
Hence, we must summon Mr. Choi, who was the investigator on the case,

134
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.449
to examine further details about it.

135
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.299
And we also disagree with number 34.

136
00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.029
Number 44 too.

137
00:06:34.799 --> 00:06:36.299
You disagree with number 44 too?

138
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.429
(Statement, Han Woo Tak)

139
00:06:37.429 --> 00:06:39.440
Does that mean we'll have to summon Mr. Han Woo Tak as well?

140
00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:42.639
The prosecution is insisting that the defendant is guilty...

141
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.810
of murder and attempted murder based on his claims,

142
00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.080
so we ought to confirm the validity of his statement here in court.

143
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.279
(Subpoena to Testify)

144
00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:53.750
Then Prosecution, will you put in a request...

145
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.819
to summon Ms. Nam, Mr. Choi, and Mr. Han so that we can...

146
00:06:56.819 --> 00:06:58.449
question them as witnesses at the next trial?

147
00:06:59.089 --> 00:07:00.690
- Yes, Your Honor. - Yes, Your Honor.

148
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.529
It's obvious that their plan is to impeach all of our witnesses.

149
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.830
It'll be a long trial.

150
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.210
What's all this?

151
00:07:20.679 --> 00:07:23.380
You've been working hard to guard Hong Joo for the last few days.

152
00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.819
I wanted to treat you. This is...

153
00:07:26.219 --> 00:07:27.420
a token of my appreciation.

154
00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.989
I feel this every time I see you.

155
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.690
I think you're quite stingy when it comes to expressing your gratitude.

156
00:07:32.719 --> 00:07:35.259
- Don't even. - No, he's quite expressive with me.

157
00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:38.360
My gosh.

158
00:07:39.299 --> 00:07:40.400
Who is this?

159
00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:43.670
Oh, that. That's...

160
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:45.330
My goodness. It must be her,

161
00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:46.900
your crush. Aren't I right?

162
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.500
What?

163
00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:50.569
Really?

164
00:07:51.509 --> 00:07:53.540
Is this shadow the girl you have a crush on?

165
00:07:54.409 --> 00:07:57.080
Yes. Well, that's right.

166
00:07:57.409 --> 00:07:58.750
She must be pretty.

167
00:07:58.949 --> 00:08:02.020
She looks like the innocent-looking, intelligent type.

168
00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.049
Aren't I right?

169
00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:05.290
Are you talking about yourself?

170
00:08:05.389 --> 00:08:06.420
No, this girl.

171
00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.520
Hey, how can you tell from her shadow alone?

172
00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.029
I can totally tell.

173
00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.529
What is wrong with your eyes?

174
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.429
Hey, Du Hyun.

175
00:08:18.299 --> 00:08:21.100
Yes, that's right. Oh, you'll come to Lee Yu Beom's trial tomorrow?

176
00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:24.739
Gosh.

177
00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.509
She's in no position to bash me.

178
00:08:27.509 --> 00:08:29.049
She can't even tell that it's her own shadow.

179
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:33.779
I know, right?

180
00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.750
So you knew.

181
00:08:37.889 --> 00:08:39.860
You've known about it anyway.

182
00:08:40.259 --> 00:08:41.290
Yes, I have.

183
00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.560
Let's not get all awkward.

184
00:08:49.469 --> 00:08:51.730
I'll pretend not to know about it, so let's keep on being friends.

185
00:08:53.799 --> 00:08:54.869
You're very understanding.

186
00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:56.909
If that's the case...

187
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:59.739
Can we really talk like friends now, then?

188
00:08:59.739 --> 00:09:02.350
Gosh, not a chance. I'm not that understanding.

189
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:05.920
My gosh, it sounds like a ton of reporters will be there tomorrow.

190
00:09:05.949 --> 00:09:07.650
I really hope that I won't make any mistakes.

191
00:09:08.179 --> 00:09:09.449
I'm so nervous.

192
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:11.719
You can't be more nervous than I am.

193
00:09:12.619 --> 00:09:14.020
I think my heart is hurting.

194
00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:15.929
Let's eat this yogurt.

195
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:17.889
- Yogurt. - Yogurt.

196
00:09:33.509 --> 00:09:36.880
Yesterday, today, and tomorrow.

197
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.549
We were used to having every day being like any other day,

198
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.119
but a very special day was about to begin.

199
00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.560
Please get in, Mr. Choi. I'll give you a ride to the court.

200
00:09:52.299 --> 00:09:53.699
Well, sure.

201
00:09:55.799 --> 00:09:57.400
For some people, today will bring joy...

202
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:00.139
or rage.

203
00:10:01.199 --> 00:10:02.239
It'll work out.

204
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:10.250
And some will remember today as a sad day for a long time.

205
00:10:16.549 --> 00:10:18.650
(Today is an important day for you. I'll be there to root for you.)

206
00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:20.520
Mr. Lee, are you ready?

207
00:10:21.659 --> 00:10:24.389
Of course. I'm perfectly ready!

208
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.770
At the end of the day,

209
00:10:33.339 --> 00:10:36.670
we'll hear someone's last words.

210
00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:39.409
"Don't cry."

211
00:10:39.909 --> 00:10:41.179
"Beat yourself up, but keep it short."

212
00:10:48.679 --> 00:10:49.719
"But..."

213
00:10:50.319 --> 00:10:52.560
"don't forget about what happened."

214
00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:57.759
I'll see you inside.

215
00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:00.259
You must be nervous.

216
00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:01.799
Yes, I am.

217
00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:08.100
Try to relax.

218
00:11:08.569 --> 00:11:11.369
People will think that you're a defendant, and I'm a prosecutor.

219
00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.610
I'll try.

220
00:11:14.139 --> 00:11:17.110
Don't think that the trial has to be harder than it actually is.

221
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:19.679
The answer is clear if you think about what makes sense.

222
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.150
Between a lawyer colluding with a serial killer...

223
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:24.489
to attempt to kill a reporter...

224
00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:27.060
and the serial killer trying to kill...

225
00:11:27.159 --> 00:11:28.889
both the lawyer and the reporter,

226
00:11:29.429 --> 00:11:30.730
what makes more sense to you?

227
00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:34.860
Well,

228
00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:37.230
I think that our arguments make more sense.

229
00:11:37.469 --> 00:11:38.469
Is that so?

230
00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.339
Gosh, I'm curious to see...

231
00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:44.409
which side the judge will find more credible.

232
00:11:44.969 --> 00:11:46.139
I'm curious too.

233
00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:48.639
Whom will he believe more this time?

234
00:11:53.663 --> 00:11:56.895
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E30 While You Were Sleeping "Stand by Me"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

235
00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:05.560
Just a second.

236
00:12:08.659 --> 00:12:09.770
Hello.

237
00:12:10.929 --> 00:12:13.469
Ms. Nam, it's been a while.

238
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.569
Are you better now?

239
00:12:17.009 --> 00:12:19.040
Yes, I'm fully recovered now.

240
00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:20.610
I'm glad to hear that.

241
00:12:27.719 --> 00:12:30.850
It's been so long, mister.

242
00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:39.630
Yes.

243
00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:42.630
I really wanted to meet you again.

244
00:12:45.469 --> 00:12:46.500
Me too.

245
00:12:54.139 --> 00:12:55.750
All rise.

246
00:13:03.819 --> 00:13:05.049
Please be seated.

247
00:13:09.029 --> 00:13:12.360
Counsel and Prosecution. Everyone is here, right?

248
00:13:12.429 --> 00:13:13.429
Yes, Your Honor.

249
00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:14.630
- Yes, Your Honor. - Yes, Your Honor.

250
00:13:21.139 --> 00:13:23.270
The prosecution is insisting that the defendant...

251
00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:27.610
killed Ha Ju Won in order to conceal that he tampered with evidence...

252
00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:29.850
while working on the IV drip serial murder case in the past.

253
00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:33.679
Whether he manipulated the evidence or not...

254
00:13:33.719 --> 00:13:35.949
is the key to solving this case.

255
00:13:36.589 --> 00:13:40.759
Mr. Choi. On December 12, 2014,

256
00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.730
you conducted a search and seizure at Myung Yi Suk's office. Correct?

257
00:13:45.699 --> 00:13:46.960
Yes, I did.

258
00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:50.830
I see "Vecaron, three vials" at the bottom of this list.

259
00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:52.130
What is Vecaron?

260
00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:54.500
It's the drug that the serial killer used...

261
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.839
to kill his victims.

262
00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:58.909
The killer injected the drug into patients via IV drips...

263
00:13:58.909 --> 00:14:00.610
and killed 11 people in total.

264
00:14:00.839 --> 00:14:03.150
As we all know, it's been revealed...

265
00:14:03.179 --> 00:14:05.110
that Ha Ju Won was the real killer,

266
00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:08.420
but some insist that the Vecaron vials are fabricated evidence.

267
00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.250
Do you agree with them?

268
00:14:11.319 --> 00:14:13.790
Yes, I do believe that it was fabricated.

269
00:14:15.489 --> 00:14:16.759
- Gosh. - That's crazy.

270
00:14:16.929 --> 00:14:19.429
The vials were crucial evidence, yet you added them...

271
00:14:19.529 --> 00:14:22.670
to the very bottom of the list with a different pen.

272
00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:23.730
What happened?

273
00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:27.040
I made the seized items list at the scene...

274
00:14:27.299 --> 00:14:30.440
and went through it again when I returned to the office...

275
00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.009
while comparing it to the actual items.

276
00:14:32.409 --> 00:14:36.150
It looks like that because what was missing on the list was added then.

277
00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:39.350
Then what about this handwriting?

278
00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:41.779
Whose handwriting is this?

279
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:47.690
Whose handwriting is this?

280
00:14:48.819 --> 00:14:50.290
It's mine.

281
00:14:52.429 --> 00:14:53.799
(Vecaron, 3 vials)

282
00:14:56.929 --> 00:14:58.469
It's mine.

283
00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.509
You were the one who conducted the search and seizure.

284
00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:07.639
You also made the seized items list.

285
00:15:07.739 --> 00:15:10.980
You added the additional seized items onto the list as well.

286
00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:15.920
Then in your opinion, whom should be suspected first...

287
00:15:16.219 --> 00:15:17.489
of tampering with the evidence?

288
00:15:22.219 --> 00:15:23.230
What's going on?

289
00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:25.960
How sneaky. Are they trying to dump it all on Mr. Choi?

290
00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.130
Your Honor, it's inappropriate to ask questions that are...

291
00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:30.299
solely based on speculations.

292
00:15:30.299 --> 00:15:32.069
Please disregard this question.

293
00:15:32.069 --> 00:15:34.639
Leading questions are permitted in cross-examinations,

294
00:15:34.639 --> 00:15:36.170
so I don't think there are any problems.

295
00:15:36.869 --> 00:15:37.869
Mr. Choi.

296
00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:39.139
Yes, Your Honor.

297
00:15:39.139 --> 00:15:42.850
You may refuse to answer the question according to Article 148...

298
00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:44.250
of the Criminal Procedure Law.

299
00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.250
Will you refuse to testify?

300
00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.719
Yes, I won't answer the question.

301
00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:55.259
Then people will think that Mr. Choi actually tampered with the evidence.

302
00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:57.230
We're in big trouble.

303
00:15:58.730 --> 00:15:59.799
I rest my case.

304
00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.730
Prosecution, do you have additional questions for the witness?

305
00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:06.139
Yes, Your Honor. We do.

306
00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:11.310
Mr. Choi.

307
00:16:11.839 --> 00:16:14.679
Where were you when you went through this list to double-check it?

308
00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:19.049
I was in Prosecutor Lee's office at Yeonju Prosecutors' Office.

309
00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:21.819
Then please name everyone who reviewed the seized items list...

310
00:16:21.819 --> 00:16:22.889
at the scene.

311
00:16:22.889 --> 00:16:24.989
Well... I, Mr. Seo,

312
00:16:24.989 --> 00:16:28.560
and Mr. Lee Yu Beom who was the prosecutor in charge of the case.

313
00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:31.159
Then three people had access to the seized items,

314
00:16:31.259 --> 00:16:33.630
which means that all three of them could've tampered with the evidence.

315
00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:35.699
- Am I right? - Yes.

316
00:16:35.929 --> 00:16:39.069
1 of the 3 people received an award...

317
00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:41.170
from the Public Prosecutor General after the case was resolved.

318
00:16:41.339 --> 00:16:42.409
Pardon me?

319
00:16:43.369 --> 00:16:44.569
An award from the Public Prosecutor General?

320
00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:46.679
Why is he asking such a random question?

321
00:16:48.409 --> 00:16:50.679
- Yes. - Who is it?

322
00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:52.619
Lawyer Lee Yu Beom received the award.

323
00:16:56.089 --> 00:16:57.350
Why didn't all of you get it?

324
00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:00.619
Well, it's because we were just investigators.

325
00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:03.159
All responsibility as well as honor...

326
00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:04.730
should go to the prosecutor, you know.

327
00:17:05.159 --> 00:17:09.029
Then when did Lawyer Lee get an offer from Hae Kwang Law Firm?

328
00:17:09.299 --> 00:17:10.500
Right after he received the award.

329
00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.400
Were you rewarded in any way after the case got solved?

330
00:17:13.799 --> 00:17:16.139
I was not rewarded in any way.

331
00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:18.839
When a number of people are suspected of evidence tampering,

332
00:17:18.869 --> 00:17:20.580
the question of who did it inevitably arises.

333
00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:23.850
The answer can be obtained easily if we tweak the question a bit.

334
00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:26.049
Who benefited from the evidence tampering?

335
00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.589
Who was the biggest beneficiary?

336
00:17:32.049 --> 00:17:33.089
Who was it?

337
00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.659
It was Lawyer Lee Yu Beom.

338
00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:43.330
I rest my case.

339
00:17:48.199 --> 00:17:49.810
Score. Nicely done.

340
00:17:50.569 --> 00:17:53.440
(The One Who Benefited from the Evidence Tampering Is the Culprit)

341
00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:56.980
(It's Lee Yu Beom!)

342
00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:59.119
It looks like he got over the hardest part.

343
00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:01.279
Yes, it seems so.

344
00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:03.650
Am I next?

345
00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.659
(Trial in Session)

346
00:18:15.929 --> 00:18:19.199
The most important thing in determining whether...

347
00:18:19.199 --> 00:18:21.869
what the defendant did was an act of self-defense or an act...

348
00:18:21.869 --> 00:18:23.440
of murder and attempted murder...

349
00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:26.779
is how the witness, Ms. Nam Hong Joo, got to the rooftop.

350
00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:30.250
The counsel is insisting that Ha Ju Won carried you on her back.

351
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:31.409
Do you remember what happened?

352
00:18:31.509 --> 00:18:33.049
Yes, I do.

353
00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:36.790
But it was actually the defendant, Lee Yu Beom, who carried me.

354
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:40.759
He's insisting that he was...

355
00:18:40.889 --> 00:18:43.360
physically incapable of carrying you because he was drugged.

356
00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:46.360
No, he was not under the influence of any drug...

357
00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:47.799
until we got to the rooftop.

358
00:18:48.529 --> 00:18:50.000
How can you be so certain?

359
00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.069
When I collapsed on the rooftop,

360
00:18:52.199 --> 00:18:53.969
I saw two people holding umbrellas.

361
00:18:58.069 --> 00:19:00.710
I clearly saw both of them holding umbrellas.

362
00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:05.049
If Ha Ju Won had carried me like the defendant is insisting,

363
00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:06.880
she wouldn't have been able to also carry an umbrella.

364
00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.889
If the defendant had been intoxicated,

365
00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:12.989
he wouldn't have thought to bring two umbrellas.

366
00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:15.589
That's true.

367
00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:18.690
Hey, Ms. Nam is so impressive. She's very smart.

368
00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.600
But the umbrellas can be explained if the defendant...

369
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:22.929
hadn't been drugged.

370
00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:29.810
He must've carried me to the rooftop completely sober,

371
00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:33.279
and Ha Ju Won must've followed him with two umbrellas.

372
00:19:37.909 --> 00:19:39.949
But he's insisting that he was physically incapable of doing it...

373
00:19:39.949 --> 00:19:41.549
as he was given the same sleep inducer as you.

374
00:19:41.619 --> 00:19:44.619
And the drug was found in the blood test he got done.

375
00:19:44.719 --> 00:19:45.759
He probably...

376
00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:49.290
took the pills himself after killing Ha Ju Won.

377
00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.730
To be able to claim that it was self-defense.

378
00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:59.000
- My gosh. - That makes sense.

379
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.299
That's crazy.

380
00:20:00.799 --> 00:20:01.940
My goodness.

381
00:20:04.069 --> 00:20:06.839
It's based on her speculations, but they're not making an objection.

382
00:20:06.839 --> 00:20:07.880
I know.

383
00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:10.150
Does that mean they acknowledge it?

384
00:20:10.679 --> 00:20:12.949
You said Ha Ju Won must've brought two umbrellas.

385
00:20:12.949 --> 00:20:14.179
Why do you think she did that?

386
00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:19.819
I think it shows that she thought she'd leave the scene with him.

387
00:20:21.489 --> 00:20:22.929
My gosh.

388
00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.159
- I knew it. - She's right.

389
00:20:25.589 --> 00:20:28.230
She would've only brought one had she thought that she'd leave alone.

390
00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:30.929
In other words, he pushed her off the building and killed her...

391
00:20:30.929 --> 00:20:32.770
when she had no intentions of killing him.

392
00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.670
That's not self-defense. That's murder.

393
00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:38.839
- She's right. - Unbelievable.

394
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:40.210
Gosh, how could he do that?

395
00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:42.750
Your Honor.

396
00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:45.480
- This is crazy. - Who's telling the truth?

397
00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:50.219
Counsel, you may question the witness now.

398
00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:51.650
Sure.

399
00:20:52.219 --> 00:20:54.219
(Defense Counsel)

400
00:20:56.159 --> 00:20:58.830
According to what you remember,

401
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.400
the defendant who wasn't drugged...

402
00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.369
carried you to the rooftop after you were drugged, right?

403
00:21:05.299 --> 00:21:06.299
Yes.

404
00:21:08.839 --> 00:21:10.940
This is what the witness...

405
00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:12.909
and the defendant took on the day of the incident.

406
00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:16.880
There are precautions for taking this.

407
00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:21.279
Would you mind reading what's written here aloud?

408
00:21:21.619 --> 00:21:22.850
I'm farsighted due to my old age.

409
00:21:28.119 --> 00:21:31.230
Would you mind reading what's written here aloud?

410
00:21:31.259 --> 00:21:32.600
I'm farsighted due to my old age.

411
00:21:38.569 --> 00:21:40.400
What's the matter? Is something wrong?

412
00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:41.600
No, it's nothing.

413
00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:47.540
"It's been reported that there can be various types of..."

414
00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:57.089
"side effects including abnormal thinking..."

415
00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:59.759
"and behavioral changes."

416
00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:03.360
"What has been reported includes visual hallucinations..."

417
00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:04.529
"Visual hallucinations,"

418
00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:06.730
"auditory hallucinations,"

419
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:08.199
"and depersonalization disorder to name a few."

420
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:09.869
That's what's written there, right?

421
00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:16.139
Are you saying I hallucinated?

422
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:19.210
No, that's not what I meant.

423
00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:22.650
I simply listed the side effects that could occur.

424
00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:25.819
I did not experience such side effects at the time of the incident.

425
00:22:25.819 --> 00:22:28.219
Most people who suffer such side effects...

426
00:22:28.219 --> 00:22:29.989
say things like that. They say...

427
00:22:31.119 --> 00:22:32.219
that they're fine.

428
00:22:34.119 --> 00:22:37.429
He turned Ms. Nam's argument into total nonsense in one blow.

429
00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:39.529
That's why he didn't make an objection earlier.

430
00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.569
He kept quiet intentionally in order to kill...

431
00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.230
the credibility of Ms. Nam's argument.

432
00:22:45.869 --> 00:22:47.940
This is crazy. Will we let him walk all over us like that?

433
00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:52.069
I clearly remember what happened.

434
00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:54.880
That man over there carried me to the rooftop.

435
00:22:54.909 --> 00:22:56.150
He was holding an umbrella,

436
00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:58.250
and he abetted Ha Ju Won's attempt to kill me.

437
00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:01.319
Even the memories of the defendant carrying you to the rooftop,

438
00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:04.989
holding an umbrella, and abetting Ha Ju Won's attempt to kill you...

439
00:23:05.049 --> 00:23:07.889
are from after you took these pills, right?

440
00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.600
Your Honor, the witness wasn't the only one who took those pills.

441
00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:20.569
The defendant is insisting that he took them too.

442
00:23:20.869 --> 00:23:23.810
If the witness' testimony is impeached because of the pills,

443
00:23:23.969 --> 00:23:26.909
all of the defendant's arguments should be impeached as well.

444
00:23:28.179 --> 00:23:30.750
He claims that he tried to save Ms. Nam's life...

445
00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:33.250
and that he only pushed Ha Ju Won because she attacked him.

446
00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:35.150
He also insists that all of it was an act of self-defense,

447
00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:36.989
but everything he believes could've been...

448
00:23:36.989 --> 00:23:38.520
hallucinations from the sleeping pills that he took.

449
00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:43.190
That's it. We can't let them walk all over us.

450
00:23:48.299 --> 00:23:50.900
Nicely done. You sure are Chief Jung's son.

451
00:24:03.449 --> 00:24:06.619
This means that your testimony will be the key in solving this case.

452
00:24:07.179 --> 00:24:08.920
The score is even now.

453
00:24:15.929 --> 00:24:17.989
Han Woo Tak holds the key now.

454
00:24:18.259 --> 00:24:22.369
Both sides' testimonies lost their credibility,

455
00:24:22.369 --> 00:24:24.830
and Woo Tak is the only witness left now.

456
00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:26.799
- Yes, sir. - When will he be questioned?

457
00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:28.869
It'll begin right away when the trial resumes at 4pm.

458
00:24:28.969 --> 00:24:32.540
Mr. Ko won't be able to get him impeached as well, right?

459
00:24:33.179 --> 00:24:35.409
Ms. Son, why are you saying such a thing?

460
00:24:35.409 --> 00:24:36.610
That won't happen.

461
00:24:36.679 --> 00:24:39.219
We have those umbrellas, you know.

462
00:24:39.219 --> 00:24:41.779
I heard Lee Yu Beom and Ha Ju Won's fingerprints were found on them.

463
00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.920
Frankly, I don't even think that we need Han Woo Tak to testify.

464
00:24:45.719 --> 00:24:47.589
The thing is, those umbrellas...

465
00:24:47.589 --> 00:24:50.159
were found on the front lawn of the building, not on the rooftop.

466
00:24:50.159 --> 00:24:51.690
It must've been because of the wind.

467
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:53.929
I heard that it was very windy that day.

468
00:24:53.929 --> 00:24:55.600
That's what we're claiming.

469
00:24:55.699 --> 00:24:58.900
They can say that they left the umbrellas on the ground floor.

470
00:24:59.869 --> 00:25:03.339
We need a testimony that witnessed those umbrellas on the rooftop.

471
00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:06.880
How do you think that Han Woo Tak will do?

472
00:25:07.679 --> 00:25:08.949
You don't need to worry.

473
00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:12.319
He's a police officer, and he was the first to arrive on the scene.

474
00:25:12.449 --> 00:25:14.319
He can certainly testify.

475
00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:20.389
What should I do?

476
00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:23.360
The culprit will get away if I make a mistake.

477
00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:31.069
Woo Tak. You don't know the colors of those umbrellas, do you?

478
00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:34.400
Listen carefully. One of them was green,

479
00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:35.739
and the other one was red.

480
00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:39.380
They'll ask you what the umbrellas looked like.

481
00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:40.839
If you can't answer that question,

482
00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:42.409
they'll find out about your color blindness.

483
00:25:42.779 --> 00:25:44.580
Then you'll have to leave the police.

484
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:45.819
So just memorize this.

485
00:25:46.119 --> 00:25:49.020
The long umbrella was green, and the three-tier one was red.

486
00:25:49.819 --> 00:25:50.850
Hong Joo.

487
00:25:51.989 --> 00:25:53.159
How did you know?

488
00:25:53.219 --> 00:25:54.889
That's not important right now.

489
00:25:57.029 --> 00:25:59.259
You absolutely can't make any mistakes. Got it?

490
00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:07.239
Forget it. You know what? Just say that you're sick and go home.

491
00:26:07.739 --> 00:26:10.670
You might give it away if that lawyer keeps interrogating you.

492
00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:13.310
Just leave now. I'll tell them that you fainted.

493
00:26:14.509 --> 00:26:17.850
Then Lee Yu Beom might get acquitted.

494
00:26:17.949 --> 00:26:19.119
That's not important right now.

495
00:26:19.619 --> 00:26:21.420
You can't leave the police force.

496
00:26:21.679 --> 00:26:23.449
You said you can never give up being a police officer.

497
00:26:23.619 --> 00:26:25.119
If they find out about your color blindness,

498
00:26:25.119 --> 00:26:26.420
you'll have to give up everything.

499
00:26:28.759 --> 00:26:30.190
Get out of here while no one is around.

500
00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.089
I'll explain it to Jae Chan.

501
00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:33.560
So you should just...

502
00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:57.819
Woo Tak.

503
00:26:59.889 --> 00:27:01.060
I won't run away.

504
00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:04.259
I won't make any mistakes.

505
00:27:07.429 --> 00:27:08.460
Don't worry.

506
00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:33.219
Mr. Han.

507
00:27:33.989 --> 00:27:35.759
Please read the oath aloud.

508
00:27:36.489 --> 00:27:38.460
If you lie after taking the oath,

509
00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:41.529
you'll be punished for perjury. You're well aware of that, right?

510
00:27:42.699 --> 00:27:44.830
Yes, Your Honor. I'm aware.

511
00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:47.069
Woo Tak.

512
00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:53.610
"Oath".

513
00:27:54.409 --> 00:27:56.750
"I solemnly affirm that the evidence to be given by me..."

514
00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:00.179
"shall be nothing but the truth. If any of it is untrue,"

515
00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:04.089
"I pledge that I will be punished for perjury."

516
00:28:39.659 --> 00:28:40.860
Oh, Hong Joo.

517
00:28:41.119 --> 00:28:42.860
Why are you alone? Where's Jae Chan?

518
00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:45.759
He had to go back home because he left his phone.

519
00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:48.299
He'll be here soon. Where's your car?

520
00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:49.630
I can't use it due to road rationing.

521
00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:51.830
We haven't taken the bus together in so long.

522
00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:18.460
- What are you doing? - What?

523
00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:20.159
Nothing. I wasn't doing anything.

524
00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:23.929
What's taking Jae Chan so long?

525
00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:25.469
I'll be late for work.
