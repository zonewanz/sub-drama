(Episode 22)

4
00:00:15.175 --> 00:00:16.176
General Manager Min.

5
00:00:16.545 --> 00:00:19.446
She wouldn't give her bag and insisted it was hers.

6
00:00:20.016 --> 00:00:21.185
Hello.

7
00:00:22.185 --> 00:00:24.716
- How... - Isn't this my home?

8
00:00:25.316 --> 00:00:27.726
I heard I'm your daughter, so I decided to move in.

9
00:00:31.426 --> 00:00:34.226
Nice to meet you. I'm Seo Ji Soo.

10
00:00:35.565 --> 00:00:36.995
Hello.

11
00:00:38.296 --> 00:00:39.665
Do I use Ji An's room?

12
00:00:40.235 --> 00:00:41.465
Is it up there?

13
00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:44.006
How did you get here?

14
00:00:44.476 --> 00:00:45.535
Why?

15
00:00:45.936 --> 00:00:47.506
Am I not supposed to be here?

16
00:00:47.506 --> 00:00:49.146
You told them to send me.

17
00:00:51.845 --> 00:00:55.385
Yes. I just didn't expect you to be here so early.

18
00:00:56.616 --> 00:00:57.616
What?

19
00:00:58.116 --> 00:00:59.116
Seo Ji Soo?

20
00:01:00.285 --> 00:01:01.556
Hello.

21
00:01:03.326 --> 00:01:06.096
How did you get here? Why didn't you call us?

22
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.965
Let's have a seat first. Then we can talk.

23
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:10.866
I'm tired, so I'd like to rest.

24
00:01:13.105 --> 00:01:14.866
We should at least introduce each other.

25
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.390
<font face="Papyrus" color="#ff8000">Subtitle ripped and resynced by redixion</font>

26
00:01:21.575 --> 00:01:23.045
I'm home.

27
00:01:25.075 --> 00:01:26.446
Who are you?

28
00:01:26.446 --> 00:01:28.885
- Are you Choi Seo Hyun? - Yes.

29
00:01:29.515 --> 00:01:30.616
How old are you?

30
00:01:30.756 --> 00:01:32.155
23.

31
00:01:32.586 --> 00:01:33.956
I'm Seo Ji Soo.

32
00:01:33.956 --> 00:01:36.655
Call me Ji Soo until it becomes official.

33
00:01:37.226 --> 00:01:38.295
Official?

34
00:01:39.495 --> 00:01:40.525
Mother?

35
00:01:41.196 --> 00:01:44.795
I haven't told Seo Hyun yet.

36
00:01:45.965 --> 00:01:47.006
Really?

37
00:01:48.135 --> 00:01:49.875
I know who you are.

38
00:01:50.176 --> 00:01:52.806
You know who I am, and so does he.

39
00:01:53.045 --> 00:01:54.206
We all know each other.

40
00:01:54.575 --> 00:01:56.946
I guess you can just tell her about me.

41
00:01:57.316 --> 00:01:58.676
Where's Ji An's room?

42
00:01:59.245 --> 00:02:02.185
Do Kyung. You better take her to her room.

43
00:02:02.816 --> 00:02:04.456
Yes, Father.

44
00:02:05.086 --> 00:02:06.155
Let's go.

45
00:02:12.695 --> 00:02:14.625
Mother. Father.

46
00:02:15.095 --> 00:02:16.565
Who is she?

47
00:02:16.896 --> 00:02:19.296
Well, let's talk in the study.

48
00:02:22.236 --> 00:02:24.035
Is this the room Ji An used,

49
00:02:24.035 --> 00:02:25.505
which was supposed to be mine?

50
00:02:26.206 --> 00:02:27.245
Yes.

51
00:02:27.546 --> 00:02:29.775
Then it must be the same as when Ji An was here.

52
00:02:32.375 --> 00:02:33.845
I don't like that.

53
00:02:34.715 --> 00:02:36.146
Change everything, please.

54
00:02:36.255 --> 00:02:37.715
I'll do that tomorrow.

55
00:02:38.456 --> 00:02:40.785
You don't even have an extra bed sheet here?

56
00:02:41.086 --> 00:02:42.725
I'll get it immediately.

57
00:02:47.266 --> 00:02:48.796
You must've been very upset.

58
00:02:49.125 --> 00:02:51.166
- I... - I know you're sorry.

59
00:02:52.565 --> 00:02:54.065
You're not upset.

60
00:02:54.905 --> 00:02:56.636
You're angry at me.

61
00:02:57.775 --> 00:02:58.775
This room is bigger...

62
00:02:58.775 --> 00:03:00.146
than the living room in my previous house.

63
00:03:02.706 --> 00:03:03.945
Unpack your stuff.

64
00:03:21.666 --> 00:03:22.666
Go rest.

65
00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:24.336
Yes, Mother.

66
00:03:34.975 --> 00:03:37.715
What is it? Do you need anything?

67
00:03:38.046 --> 00:03:39.245
I wanted to get some water.

68
00:03:40.586 --> 00:03:41.586
Just stay here.

69
00:03:43.116 --> 00:03:44.516
A glass of water, please.

70
00:03:45.486 --> 00:03:47.356
Call the maid if you need anything.

71
00:03:47.486 --> 00:03:49.755
I'll tell you her phone number.

72
00:03:50.025 --> 00:03:52.025
I don't need to make a call for water.

73
00:03:53.025 --> 00:03:55.195
Gosh, that TV is huge.

74
00:03:58.896 --> 00:04:02.236
You can't watch TV in the living room at night.

75
00:04:03.206 --> 00:04:04.206
Why?

76
00:04:06.035 --> 00:04:07.845
Well, that's what we do here.

77
00:04:08.706 --> 00:04:10.046
But this is the living room.

78
00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:12.345
Isn't the living room for the entire family?

79
00:04:13.986 --> 00:04:15.315
You should read books...

80
00:04:15.846 --> 00:04:17.486
rather than watching TV.

81
00:04:18.185 --> 00:04:19.955
But I don't like books.

82
00:04:22.125 --> 00:04:23.255
- Here's the water. - Okay.

83
00:04:23.395 --> 00:04:24.526
Thank you.

84
00:04:26.596 --> 00:04:28.995
Must I watch TV on my cellphone now?

85
00:04:41.245 --> 00:04:43.346
How can my sister change overnight?

86
00:04:44.245 --> 00:04:46.846
I know you're confused, but we're confused too.

87
00:04:47.286 --> 00:04:48.885
You must understand her.

88
00:04:49.416 --> 00:04:51.315
That new Eun Seok?

89
00:04:51.656 --> 00:04:53.255
Call her Ji Soo for now.

90
00:04:53.825 --> 00:04:55.325
Eun Seok is ridiculous.

91
00:04:55.926 --> 00:04:58.255
Why didn't she tell you until she was sent out...

92
00:04:58.255 --> 00:04:59.666
after what she said to me?

93
00:05:00.195 --> 00:05:01.625
What did she say to you?

94
00:05:02.125 --> 00:05:04.695
She said you'll help...

95
00:05:04.695 --> 00:05:06.435
whenever asked sincerely.

96
00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:09.736
She told me to ask you if I ever get in trouble.

97
00:05:10.406 --> 00:05:11.705
Did Ji An...

98
00:05:12.505 --> 00:05:13.645
really say that?

99
00:05:15.606 --> 00:05:18.416
When and why did she say that to you?

100
00:05:18.745 --> 00:05:20.515
Well, we just...

101
00:05:20.885 --> 00:05:22.585
happened to get on that topic.

102
00:05:23.286 --> 00:05:26.625
Did Eun Seok go back to her house then?

103
00:05:37.866 --> 00:05:39.265
She went back to her house.

104
00:05:41.065 --> 00:05:43.005
Then that must've been her farewell to me.

105
00:05:45.835 --> 00:05:47.705
I was starting to like her, but she left.

106
00:05:53.585 --> 00:05:54.585
Goodnight.

107
00:06:21.145 --> 00:06:23.046
What were Tae Soo and Mi Jung thinking...

108
00:06:23.046 --> 00:06:25.216
to send her at this hour?

109
00:06:25.315 --> 00:06:26.515
They didn't even call us.

110
00:06:26.745 --> 00:06:30.286
I think she felt betrayed and came out of anger.

111
00:06:31.385 --> 00:06:33.356
But still, she should've told us.

112
00:06:33.556 --> 00:06:35.056
She should know that's rude at her age.

113
00:06:35.156 --> 00:06:37.755
She's our real daughter. Aren't you happy?

114
00:06:38.596 --> 00:06:40.666
You weren't like this when Seo Ji An was here.

115
00:06:43.495 --> 00:06:45.296
I didn't expect her...

116
00:06:45.935 --> 00:06:47.306
to come here so early.

117
00:06:48.106 --> 00:06:49.736
Aren't you going to check on Eun Seok?

118
00:06:50.036 --> 00:06:51.705
You should at least wish her a good night.

119
00:06:54.005 --> 00:06:55.906
Is it that easy for you...

120
00:06:56.145 --> 00:06:59.075
to treat her as our daughter, Eun Seok?

121
00:06:59.075 --> 00:07:00.385
She's our daughter.

122
00:07:02.445 --> 00:07:04.856
To me, she feels like a stranger.

123
00:07:05.556 --> 00:07:07.556
It's like my daughter has been switched overnight.

124
00:07:08.726 --> 00:07:11.596
That's all the more reason for us to get to know her.

125
00:07:12.296 --> 00:07:13.625
When I saw her in the afternoon,

126
00:07:14.325 --> 00:07:16.125
she seemed deeply hurt by what happened.

127
00:07:16.366 --> 00:07:18.395
But that's not an excuse for taking it out on us.

128
00:07:18.395 --> 00:07:19.435
I don't know...

129
00:07:19.435 --> 00:07:21.205
if that's an act or that's how she is.

130
00:07:22.106 --> 00:07:24.505
I share the blame for believing Yang Mi Jung,

131
00:07:24.505 --> 00:07:26.906
but it was Yang Mi Jung who told that hideous lie.

132
00:07:28.106 --> 00:07:29.575
She lied,

133
00:07:30.375 --> 00:07:32.546
and because we believed that lie,

134
00:07:33.116 --> 00:07:34.585
she got hurt the most...

135
00:07:34.585 --> 00:07:36.286
when she had nothing to do with this mess.

136
00:07:39.255 --> 00:07:40.385
You're right.

137
00:07:41.156 --> 00:07:42.786
I'm to blame.

138
00:07:43.995 --> 00:07:46.265
I'm sure she's going through a hard time now.

139
00:07:46.765 --> 00:07:47.825
For the time being,

140
00:07:48.625 --> 00:07:50.395
let her do whatever she wants.

141
00:07:52.536 --> 00:07:53.666
Okay.

142
00:07:54.736 --> 00:07:56.205
Let's just watch her from afar for now.

143
00:08:07.645 --> 00:08:08.645
Ji Tae.

144
00:08:09.315 --> 00:08:10.356
Yes?

145
00:08:11.815 --> 00:08:13.625
I'm worried about...

146
00:08:13.625 --> 00:08:15.026
both Ji Soo and Mother.

147
00:08:15.856 --> 00:08:17.026
I really am.

148
00:08:18.856 --> 00:08:19.926
Don't be.

149
00:08:20.096 --> 00:08:21.866
This was long overdue.

150
00:08:22.866 --> 00:08:24.065
They've corrected what was wrong.

151
00:08:24.565 --> 00:08:25.695
It's a good thing.

152
00:08:27.135 --> 00:08:28.505
If it's a good thing,

153
00:08:28.505 --> 00:08:30.176
what are you worried about?

154
00:08:32.105 --> 00:08:33.345
About us.

155
00:08:33.605 --> 00:08:34.776
About us?

156
00:08:36.615 --> 00:08:37.746
There's no way...

157
00:08:38.475 --> 00:08:40.046
her family would just let this slide.

158
00:08:40.945 --> 00:08:42.146
My parents switched their daughter.

159
00:08:45.156 --> 00:08:46.985
That crossed my mind too,

160
00:08:47.855 --> 00:08:49.325
but they can't report this to the police.

161
00:08:49.485 --> 00:08:51.156
Ji Soo won't let that happen.

162
00:08:52.126 --> 00:08:55.166
But still. They won't forgive my parents easily.

163
00:08:56.666 --> 00:08:58.166
The only thing our family has...

164
00:08:58.735 --> 00:09:00.335
is the deposit for this house.

165
00:09:00.906 --> 00:09:01.906
And besides that,

166
00:09:02.705 --> 00:09:04.006
they might come after me.

167
00:09:04.205 --> 00:09:05.205
What?

168
00:09:06.345 --> 00:09:07.345
No way.

169
00:09:10.615 --> 00:09:12.715
You never know what lies ahead of you,

170
00:09:12.815 --> 00:09:14.585
so I've been just thinking about it.

171
00:09:15.916 --> 00:09:17.315
If I don't make any preparations,

172
00:09:18.115 --> 00:09:20.085
I would be very sorry to you.

173
00:09:21.085 --> 00:09:22.556
So I'm going to prepare myself.

174
00:09:24.056 --> 00:09:25.126
My gosh.

175
00:09:25.855 --> 00:09:27.825
I was just thinking of the possibility,

176
00:09:28.296 --> 00:09:30.735
but you're preparing for what happens after that.

177
00:09:31.636 --> 00:09:32.935
For me.

178
00:09:43.815 --> 00:09:44.945
Ji Soo...

179
00:09:47.046 --> 00:09:48.345
will be safe there, right?

180
00:09:50.656 --> 00:09:52.656
That's where she belongs.

181
00:09:52.656 --> 00:09:54.026
So I'm sure she's safe there.

182
00:09:55.786 --> 00:09:57.325
I know Ji Soo left,

183
00:09:57.325 --> 00:09:59.825
but we must find Ji An first.

184
00:10:01.225 --> 00:10:03.266
Where could she be now?

185
00:10:05.365 --> 00:10:07.235
She will come back...

186
00:10:08.406 --> 00:10:09.506
after resting a few days.

187
00:10:11.636 --> 00:10:12.705
She'll come back.

188
00:10:14.676 --> 00:10:15.676
She will.

189
00:10:16.776 --> 00:10:20.146
I'm going to the police station tomorrow.

190
00:10:21.715 --> 00:10:23.815
Ji An isn't coming back because she hates me.

191
00:10:32.926 --> 00:10:35.465
She should let us know that she got there safely.

192
00:10:41.965 --> 00:10:44.506
Your real parents...

193
00:10:45.636 --> 00:10:47.705
want us to send you.

194
00:10:48.376 --> 00:10:49.575
They want you to move in.

195
00:10:50.146 --> 00:10:51.445
If she had said...

196
00:10:51.445 --> 00:10:53.715
that I was their daughter from the beginning,

197
00:10:54.685 --> 00:10:57.156
would you have said what you're saying now?

198
00:10:58.016 --> 00:11:00.056
Would you have said I must go?

199
00:11:01.286 --> 00:11:02.526
I would have.

200
00:11:03.095 --> 00:11:05.325
They're your real parents.

201
00:11:07.666 --> 00:11:08.695
Right.

202
00:11:09.766 --> 00:11:12.365
This is my house and my room.

203
00:11:15.766 --> 00:11:17.935
Gosh, this bed is nice.

204
00:11:18.406 --> 00:11:19.406
Ji An can't scold me...

205
00:11:19.406 --> 00:11:21.406
for my bad sleeping habits now.

206
00:11:51.435 --> 00:11:53.605
- Eun... - Please call me Ji Soo.

207
00:11:56.916 --> 00:11:58.246
Since you're at our house,

208
00:11:58.246 --> 00:11:59.886
you're Eun Seok now.

209
00:12:01.546 --> 00:12:03.656
I didn't come here to be your daughter.

210
00:12:03.656 --> 00:12:05.115
I'm here because I had nowhere to go.

211
00:12:06.485 --> 00:12:08.156
You had nowhere to go?

212
00:12:09.126 --> 00:12:11.556
I came because they didn't see me as their daughter.

213
00:12:12.126 --> 00:12:14.225
And I was also curious about why...

214
00:12:14.225 --> 00:12:15.526
Ji An liked it here.

215
00:12:21.365 --> 00:12:22.906
We should talk after breakfast.

216
00:12:23.475 --> 00:12:24.935
But I must go to work.

217
00:12:25.036 --> 00:12:26.676
What time is it?

218
00:12:27.046 --> 00:12:29.006
Gosh, I'll be late. Thank you for breakfast.

219
00:12:35.416 --> 00:12:36.416
I'm sorry.

220
00:12:49.266 --> 00:12:51.266
I'll stay at home today.

221
00:12:51.266 --> 00:12:53.205
I can't go to work since I'm too exhausted.

222
00:12:53.835 --> 00:12:55.935
Redecorate Eun Seok's room while you rest.

223
00:12:57.036 --> 00:12:58.176
I will.

224
00:13:00.445 --> 00:13:02.776
Mother, may I come in?

225
00:13:03.546 --> 00:13:04.815
Sure. Come in.

226
00:13:08.585 --> 00:13:11.185
Mother, are you not well?

227
00:13:12.516 --> 00:13:14.656
It's nothing. What is it?

228
00:13:15.556 --> 00:13:16.725
Well,

229
00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:18.855
Driver Ryu sprained his ankle.

230
00:13:18.855 --> 00:13:21.026
He can't work for a week, so I sent him on vacation.

231
00:13:21.026 --> 00:13:22.496
I'll take taxis for the time being.

232
00:13:23.536 --> 00:13:25.465
Okay. I got it.

233
00:13:33.806 --> 00:13:36.246
Go to the restaurant, and work hard...

234
00:13:36.516 --> 00:13:38.445
until you hear from them.

235
00:13:42.786 --> 00:13:45.455
Mi Jung? My gosh, Mi Jung.

236
00:13:46.325 --> 00:13:49.386
Hey, you. What happened to you?

237
00:13:49.825 --> 00:13:52.026
After going out to find Ji Soo late at night,

238
00:13:52.026 --> 00:13:53.225
you didn't call back,

239
00:13:53.225 --> 00:13:54.766
and you weren't at the restaurant either.

240
00:13:56.166 --> 00:13:57.996
Well, about that...

241
00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:01.565
Hae Ja.

242
00:14:02.766 --> 00:14:04.205
What should I do?

243
00:14:06.246 --> 00:14:09.715
My goodness. Mi Jung.

244
00:14:11.916 --> 00:14:13.416
I'm about to lose both of my daughters...

245
00:14:13.416 --> 00:14:14.746
for what I did.

246
00:14:15.916 --> 00:14:18.315
I can't reach Ji An wherever she is.

247
00:14:19.215 --> 00:14:20.585
And Ji Soo...

248
00:14:21.355 --> 00:14:22.455
She's so tenderhearted.

249
00:14:22.455 --> 00:14:24.426
I'm worried how she will survive...

250
00:14:24.426 --> 00:14:25.796
in that family.

251
00:14:27.166 --> 00:14:28.426
I'm so terrified.

252
00:14:30.036 --> 00:14:32.396
You already know Ji Soo is safe.

253
00:14:32.496 --> 00:14:34.636
You must find Ji An first.

254
00:14:36.636 --> 00:14:38.235
I guess she can't face me.

255
00:14:39.006 --> 00:14:40.506
She's hiding from us.

256
00:14:42.605 --> 00:14:45.376
Then why did you do that to begin with?

257
00:14:46.215 --> 00:14:47.215
Wait, no.

258
00:14:47.215 --> 00:14:48.945
This is not the time to point fingers.

259
00:14:50.715 --> 00:14:51.955
Hey.

260
00:14:52.556 --> 00:14:55.325
Poor you. What will you do now?

261
00:14:56.426 --> 00:14:57.595
- Hae Ja. - Yes?

262
00:14:57.595 --> 00:14:59.556
I must hurry off to the restaurant.

263
00:15:09.365 --> 00:15:10.575
What is it?

264
00:15:11.705 --> 00:15:13.246
I was wondering how Ji An is doing.

265
00:15:13.306 --> 00:15:15.146
When she came back home,

266
00:15:15.146 --> 00:15:16.146
did she seem okay?

267
00:15:16.146 --> 00:15:17.315
Ji An?

268
00:15:17.945 --> 00:15:20.685
She didn't come home until I left yesterday.

269
00:15:21.386 --> 00:15:22.546
She didn't come back?

270
00:15:22.546 --> 00:15:24.756
I doubt she came back last night either.

271
00:15:24.955 --> 00:15:26.085
Did she call you?

272
00:15:26.426 --> 00:15:27.626
Where did she say she was?

273
00:15:27.626 --> 00:15:29.156
Do you think she would call me?

274
00:15:29.286 --> 00:15:31.126
She neither called nor returned home.

275
00:15:31.396 --> 00:15:32.595
Aren't you worried about her?

276
00:15:32.595 --> 00:15:35.426
She's very proud and strong.

277
00:15:36.095 --> 00:15:37.636
She's probably getting some fresh air...

278
00:15:37.636 --> 00:15:39.365
because she doesn't want to see her parents.

279
00:15:39.605 --> 00:15:41.136
Where do you think she went?

280
00:15:41.565 --> 00:15:43.935
You should at least call Ji An's close friends.

281
00:15:43.935 --> 00:15:46.205
Why are you worried about Ji An?

282
00:15:46.205 --> 00:15:48.046
She's not your sister.

283
00:15:48.146 --> 00:15:49.815
She was my sister for a while.

284
00:15:49.815 --> 00:15:52.176
Yes, she was. But you know that she isn't now.

285
00:15:52.176 --> 00:15:54.345
It wasn't like she was here for 1 or 2 years.

286
00:15:55.585 --> 00:15:57.315
She'll come back after a few days.

287
00:16:06.725 --> 00:16:08.026
She didn't come home?

288
00:16:09.396 --> 00:16:11.496
I definitely saw her heading to her house.

289
00:16:37.195 --> 00:16:38.296
Seo Ji An.

290
00:16:40.565 --> 00:16:41.926
Where are you?

291
00:16:46.095 --> 00:16:48.306
She said you'll help...

292
00:16:48.306 --> 00:16:50.475
whenever asked sincerely.

293
00:16:53.345 --> 00:16:54.605
Where...

294
00:16:57.876 --> 00:16:59.146
did you send these photos from?

295
00:17:02.916 --> 00:17:05.786
I know my daughter well.

296
00:17:05.786 --> 00:17:07.986
Something must have gone wrong.

297
00:17:08.726 --> 00:17:11.895
She's been reported missing, so please wait.

298
00:17:11.895 --> 00:17:13.665
Wait.

299
00:17:13.665 --> 00:17:15.425
Reporting her missing isn't good enough.

300
00:17:15.425 --> 00:17:17.165
I need to find her right now.

301
00:17:17.536 --> 00:17:20.236
Can you please track her location?

302
00:17:20.236 --> 00:17:23.105
Sir, I understand that you're worried,

303
00:17:23.105 --> 00:17:24.375
but your daughter is an adult.

304
00:17:24.605 --> 00:17:27.575
Missing for three days is not a case.

305
00:17:28.206 --> 00:17:30.016
You said she was in shock.

306
00:17:30.016 --> 00:17:31.345
It's been four days.

307
00:17:32.016 --> 00:17:34.615
Because she was in shock, she's in danger.

308
00:17:35.286 --> 00:17:38.885
She would've called unless she was going to die.

309
00:17:46.726 --> 00:17:47.796
This is Ji An's resume.

310
00:17:47.865 --> 00:17:50.196
Contact all her old school mates...

311
00:17:50.196 --> 00:17:51.696
and ex-colleagues.

312
00:17:51.696 --> 00:17:53.405
See if anyone knows her whereabouts.

313
00:17:53.536 --> 00:17:54.605
Yes, sir.

314
00:17:54.605 --> 00:17:56.635
Make sure not to make it sound strange to them.

315
00:17:56.835 --> 00:17:58.706
Make sure you don't do any harm to Ji An.

316
00:17:58.706 --> 00:18:00.446
I know that much, sir.

317
00:18:00.446 --> 00:18:02.546
And hire someone to guard her house.

318
00:18:02.946 --> 00:18:04.546
Tell him to call me as soon as she comes in.

319
00:18:05.216 --> 00:18:06.786
- Hurry. - All right, sir.

320
00:18:16.996 --> 00:18:18.825
I came to the address Mr. Seo Tae Soo gave.

321
00:18:19.226 --> 00:18:20.595
And it's a remote area.

322
00:18:21.496 --> 00:18:23.536
There used to be around 10 houses over the bridge.

323
00:18:23.865 --> 00:18:26.766
But after the big mountain fire, they all left.

324
00:18:27.806 --> 00:18:30.736
Jo Soon Ok abandoned our son in such a place.

325
00:18:31.476 --> 00:18:34.476
Why did Myung Hee forgive her?

326
00:18:40.246 --> 00:18:41.786
They couldn't take her to the police because...

327
00:18:41.786 --> 00:18:43.115
they were afraid of getting caught.

328
00:18:43.556 --> 00:18:45.615
So they left her there and watched her...

329
00:18:45.756 --> 00:18:47.226
until someone took her.

330
00:18:53.865 --> 00:18:56.466
(Kang Chul Min)

331
00:18:58.496 --> 00:19:00.006
(Kang Chul Min)

332
00:19:00.006 --> 00:19:02.936
(Kang Chul Min)

333
00:19:06.135 --> 00:19:08.706
(Kang Chul Min)

334
00:19:12.645 --> 00:19:14.486
They didn't write the letter.

335
00:19:16.915 --> 00:19:18.615
Did they ask someone to write it?

336
00:19:29.595 --> 00:19:30.766
Ma'am.

337
00:19:31.466 --> 00:19:34.105
I don't know what the real Eun Seok likes.

338
00:19:34.706 --> 00:19:36.276
What kind of furniture should I get?

339
00:19:37.905 --> 00:19:39.845
Something different.

340
00:19:41.105 --> 00:19:42.915
Just get whatever you see fit.

341
00:19:43.746 --> 00:19:44.915
I will do that, ma'am.

342
00:19:56.256 --> 00:19:59.155
I didn't know your style, so I decorated it.

343
00:19:59.155 --> 00:20:00.196
Do you like it?

344
00:20:00.665 --> 00:20:03.335
I love it.

345
00:21:03.796 --> 00:21:05.726
All right.

346
00:21:06.825 --> 00:21:08.565
Today, I will deliver the bread.

347
00:21:08.625 --> 00:21:10.095
What? Why?

348
00:21:10.835 --> 00:21:11.895
Just because.

349
00:21:12.165 --> 00:21:14.065
You can't.

350
00:21:15.565 --> 00:21:18.806
You can't. You can't like a married woman.

351
00:21:19.036 --> 00:21:20.145
What are you...

352
00:21:20.506 --> 00:21:21.546
Hey!

353
00:21:21.976 --> 00:21:23.016
Here.

354
00:21:23.575 --> 00:21:25.115
Actually,

355
00:21:26.286 --> 00:21:27.885
you should take it back.

356
00:21:28.446 --> 00:21:29.446
Pardon me?

357
00:21:29.986 --> 00:21:31.885
I won't get breads from your bakery now.

358
00:21:32.486 --> 00:21:33.585
Here.

359
00:21:33.825 --> 00:21:35.686
This is the money I owe.

360
00:21:37.825 --> 00:21:40.226
It's because my boss is bothering you, isn't it?

361
00:21:42.796 --> 00:21:44.766
I am sorry. It's my fault.

362
00:21:45.236 --> 00:21:47.436
I shouldn't have asked you to buy our bread.

363
00:21:48.436 --> 00:21:51.875
That's not it. It's not your fault.

364
00:21:52.736 --> 00:21:56.006
I don't understand why he's like that.

365
00:21:56.246 --> 00:21:58.446
He doesn't care about money or marriage.

366
00:21:58.615 --> 00:22:01.286
Living alone, he just cares about his bread.

367
00:22:02.286 --> 00:22:06.256
I think he lost his mind because you're too pretty.

368
00:22:08.026 --> 00:22:09.355
He lives alone?

369
00:22:10.226 --> 00:22:11.556
But he's married.

370
00:22:11.556 --> 00:22:14.196
He's not. He lives alone in the room downstairs.

371
00:22:14.196 --> 00:22:15.565
He has never been married.

372
00:22:16.736 --> 00:22:19.095
He has never been married?

373
00:22:20.135 --> 00:22:22.665
Please put a ribbon, "Happy Anniversary".

374
00:22:22.665 --> 00:22:23.706
Okay.

375
00:22:27.946 --> 00:22:31.115
I can bring the bread.

376
00:22:33.115 --> 00:22:34.885
You don't like that, do you?

377
00:22:35.645 --> 00:22:37.256
I would hate it too.

378
00:22:37.615 --> 00:22:39.516
I will just take it to him.

379
00:22:40.085 --> 00:22:41.355
Take care.

380
00:22:57.675 --> 00:22:59.276
Display this too.

381
00:22:59.506 --> 00:23:01.405
She won't take your bread anymore.

382
00:23:03.075 --> 00:23:04.976
- She won't take my bread? - No.

383
00:23:05.276 --> 00:23:07.446
She settled the balance too.

384
00:23:15.756 --> 00:23:17.226
You can work alone in the morning.

385
00:23:18.155 --> 00:23:19.456
No!

386
00:23:19.766 --> 00:23:21.496
He shouldn't do that.

387
00:23:32.375 --> 00:23:34.046
Sunwoo Hee?

388
00:23:34.046 --> 00:23:35.875
Don't you remember me?

389
00:23:36.516 --> 00:23:38.446
I am Nam Goo. Kang Nam Goo.

390
00:23:38.546 --> 00:23:40.786
I used to sell hotteok in front of your school.

391
00:23:40.786 --> 00:23:41.885
Don't you remember me?

392
00:23:41.915 --> 00:23:43.756
I was in too much of a hurry last time.

393
00:23:43.756 --> 00:23:44.956
Is your husband well?

394
00:23:45.716 --> 00:23:47.456
By the way, who made this bread?

395
00:23:47.925 --> 00:23:49.355
Does he use good flour?

396
00:23:51.095 --> 00:23:52.296
No way.

397
00:23:53.296 --> 00:23:54.325
No way.

398
00:24:01.665 --> 00:24:03.006
Honey.

399
00:24:04.375 --> 00:24:06.105
It's really fun.

400
00:24:06.405 --> 00:24:07.976
It's not tiring at all.

401
00:24:11.476 --> 00:24:13.286
Honey. Honey.

402
00:24:14.415 --> 00:24:16.016
Don't buy it.

403
00:24:16.456 --> 00:24:18.815
I will get upset if you buy more things.

404
00:24:26.996 --> 00:24:28.196
Stop it.

405
00:24:29.696 --> 00:24:30.895
Stop what?

406
00:24:31.635 --> 00:24:32.736
What...

407
00:24:39.375 --> 00:24:40.546
You...

408
00:24:41.746 --> 00:24:43.216
You knew.

409
00:24:44.575 --> 00:24:45.645
Everything.

410
00:24:46.175 --> 00:24:47.415
You knew everything.

411
00:24:48.385 --> 00:24:50.456
Why did you do that then?

412
00:24:51.885 --> 00:24:53.226
Did you want to avenge the woman...

413
00:24:53.726 --> 00:24:56.155
who became miserable after leaving you?

414
00:24:57.256 --> 00:24:58.456
Did you want to see me...

415
00:24:58.855 --> 00:25:01.095
pretending to be happy?

416
00:25:02.365 --> 00:25:03.696
I wanted to see you like this.

417
00:25:07.065 --> 00:25:09.135
What do you...

418
00:25:09.905 --> 00:25:11.006
You're a fool.

419
00:25:11.976 --> 00:25:13.075
You're an idiot.

420
00:25:14.806 --> 00:25:16.915
Where did the old Sunwoo Hee go?

421
00:25:18.276 --> 00:25:19.446
You were always tired,

422
00:25:20.585 --> 00:25:21.786
and scared.

423
00:25:24.355 --> 00:25:25.655
That's not who I wanted to see.

424
00:25:27.226 --> 00:25:28.456
I wanted to see the old Sunwoo Hee.

425
00:25:29.456 --> 00:25:31.996
You used to be feisty and loud like this.

426
00:25:34.325 --> 00:25:35.425
I missed...

427
00:25:36.365 --> 00:25:38.135
that Sunwoo Hee.

428
00:25:42.036 --> 00:25:43.105
How...

429
00:25:53.186 --> 00:25:54.415
I can't believe this.

430
00:25:57.786 --> 00:25:59.516
You are unbelievable, Nam Goo.

431
00:26:01.385 --> 00:26:02.686
Time is a scary thing.

432
00:26:02.996 --> 00:26:05.496
You're doing a one-man show.

433
00:26:06.966 --> 00:26:09.526
You are just the person...

434
00:26:09.696 --> 00:26:11.496
I ended with 17 years ago.

435
00:26:11.736 --> 00:26:13.565
You're nothing more or nothing less than that.

436
00:26:14.466 --> 00:26:17.006
Take a trip down the memory lane alone.

437
00:26:17.405 --> 00:26:18.835
It's time to open the cafe.

438
00:26:29.956 --> 00:26:30.956
Okay.

439
00:26:32.655 --> 00:26:33.655
I will go.

440
00:26:35.385 --> 00:26:37.226
I need to sell my bread too.

441
00:26:38.996 --> 00:26:40.095
Go then.

442
00:26:41.165 --> 00:26:42.196
Okay.

443
00:26:43.036 --> 00:26:44.065
I will go now.

444
00:26:45.996 --> 00:26:47.365
I can come back later.

445
00:26:48.266 --> 00:26:49.436
I will go.

446
00:27:11.026 --> 00:27:13.026
Let's see. Let's see.

447
00:27:13.026 --> 00:27:15.496
Let's see from which angle it was shot.

448
00:27:19.736 --> 00:27:22.006
Maybe I am overreacting.

449
00:27:32.645 --> 00:27:33.786
What?

450
00:27:40.686 --> 00:27:42.885
That jerk!

451
00:27:44.196 --> 00:27:45.756
- Excuse me. - My gosh.

452
00:27:47.796 --> 00:27:49.996
So that's when this was shot.

453
00:27:54.436 --> 00:27:57.105
Am I making 20,000 dollars in no time?

454
00:27:57.706 --> 00:28:00.506
Great.

455
00:28:01.075 --> 00:28:02.175
All right.

456
00:28:02.175 --> 00:28:04.575
(Ji Tae)

457
00:28:04.976 --> 00:28:08.115
(Bankbook)

458
00:28:09.016 --> 00:28:11.186
I guess it's time to tell my mom.

459
00:28:12.355 --> 00:28:13.825
Should I tell Ji Tae first?

460
00:28:20.696 --> 00:28:21.966
Yes, darling.

461
00:28:22.766 --> 00:28:24.766
Let's eat lunch together.

462
00:28:24.865 --> 00:28:26.036
I am sorry.

463
00:28:26.036 --> 00:28:28.236
I have an appointment with my boss.

464
00:28:28.736 --> 00:28:30.006
Is that right?

465
00:28:30.306 --> 00:28:31.306
I'm sorry.

466
00:28:31.306 --> 00:28:32.635
I'll see you at home.

467
00:28:33.046 --> 00:28:34.075
Okay.

468
00:28:34.075 --> 00:28:36.446
Tell your boss to treat you something good.

469
00:28:36.746 --> 00:28:37.875
Okay.

470
00:28:49.226 --> 00:28:50.925
If your in-laws...

471
00:28:50.925 --> 00:28:52.756
have migrated to Canada,

472
00:28:52.756 --> 00:28:54.425
it'll be easy to be invited to migrate.

473
00:28:54.925 --> 00:28:56.996
I see. Thank you.

474
00:28:57.796 --> 00:28:59.395
I will take this.

475
00:28:59.395 --> 00:29:00.766
Sure.

476
00:29:04.506 --> 00:29:06.776
(Ji Ho)

477
00:29:16.216 --> 00:29:17.256
Here.

478
00:29:17.256 --> 00:29:18.315
Thanks.

479
00:29:19.085 --> 00:29:21.655
It's been a long time since I bought you lunch.

480
00:29:21.655 --> 00:29:22.855
You should eat something better.

481
00:29:23.125 --> 00:29:26.026
Whom I eat with is more important,

482
00:29:26.026 --> 00:29:28.065
and as long as I like it, it's the best food.

483
00:29:28.065 --> 00:29:30.996
You always interpret things in your own ways.

484
00:29:32.296 --> 00:29:33.665
This is really good.

485
00:29:33.865 --> 00:29:35.605
It's even better because I'm here with you.

486
00:29:36.605 --> 00:29:38.236
Why are you being so nice today?

487
00:29:38.236 --> 00:29:39.405
It's strange.

488
00:29:41.246 --> 00:29:42.306
The thing is...

489
00:29:50.256 --> 00:29:51.286
Here.

490
00:29:51.286 --> 00:29:52.315
(Ji Tae)

491
00:29:53.026 --> 00:29:54.256
It's yours.

492
00:29:54.855 --> 00:29:55.925
Mine?

493
00:30:02.825 --> 00:30:05.766
(13,650 dollars)

494
00:30:07.806 --> 00:30:10.105
13,650 dollars.

495
00:30:12.135 --> 00:30:14.306
What's this?

496
00:30:15.345 --> 00:30:16.716
Starting January, you gave me 1,000 dollars...

497
00:30:16.716 --> 00:30:18.645
a month for the tutoring and the books.

498
00:30:18.645 --> 00:30:20.446
And Mom gave me 300 dollars a month.

499
00:30:20.446 --> 00:30:22.585
Ji An sometimes gave me money too.

500
00:30:22.585 --> 00:30:24.216
I didn't use any of them.

501
00:30:24.216 --> 00:30:25.516
I saved everything in there.

502
00:30:27.585 --> 00:30:28.625
Then you...

503
00:30:28.625 --> 00:30:30.925
Right. I am not going to college.

504
00:30:30.925 --> 00:30:32.756
I am going to save money and start my own business.

505
00:30:33.595 --> 00:30:35.466
I told Dad already.

506
00:30:35.466 --> 00:30:37.565
And I made a bankbook for you...

507
00:30:37.565 --> 00:30:38.966
so that I can tell you everything...

508
00:30:38.966 --> 00:30:40.635
and give back what belongs to you.

509
00:30:40.966 --> 00:30:42.135
Hey.

510
00:30:44.936 --> 00:30:47.476
Ji Tae, I will briefly tell you about my plan.

511
00:30:47.476 --> 00:30:48.776
Listen first.

512
00:30:50.046 --> 00:30:51.175
There's...

513
00:30:52.075 --> 00:30:53.385
something more important than that.

514
00:30:54.645 --> 00:30:55.885
It's something you should know.

515
00:30:56.686 --> 00:30:58.216
Something I should know?

516
00:30:59.056 --> 00:31:00.155
What is that?

517
00:31:05.625 --> 00:31:06.625
Does this...

518
00:31:08.026 --> 00:31:09.266
make sense?

519
00:31:10.165 --> 00:31:11.766
How can this happen?

520
00:31:11.766 --> 00:31:13.405
How can Mom and Dad...

521
00:31:15.206 --> 00:31:16.276
So...

522
00:31:16.806 --> 00:31:19.135
Ji Soo lives there now?

523
00:31:19.645 --> 00:31:22.006
I know you're surprised, but calm down.

524
00:31:22.946 --> 00:31:24.075
Where is Ji An then?

525
00:31:24.075 --> 00:31:25.716
Where is she now?

526
00:31:26.175 --> 00:31:29.085
Ji An is out of reach.

527
00:31:29.345 --> 00:31:30.486
Out of reach?

528
00:31:31.915 --> 00:31:33.526
Where is she?

529
00:31:34.186 --> 00:31:36.496
My goodness.

530
00:31:36.796 --> 00:31:39.766
She must need time to think.

531
00:31:40.966 --> 00:31:43.536
Just pretend you don't know about it.

532
00:31:46.436 --> 00:31:47.806
Dad...

533
00:31:49.605 --> 00:31:50.675
Ji Tae.

534
00:31:51.105 --> 00:31:52.706
So that's why Dad ran after her...

535
00:31:52.706 --> 00:31:54.875
the day she left, isn't it?

536
00:31:54.875 --> 00:31:56.546
She wanted to stop her. Right?

537
00:32:05.815 --> 00:32:06.956
Ji An.

538
00:32:07.986 --> 00:32:09.186
Are you all right?

539
00:32:10.125 --> 00:32:11.796
You're okay, right?

540
00:32:12.325 --> 00:32:14.125
Where are you?

541
00:32:16.436 --> 00:32:18.466
You know that I'm always on your side, right?

542
00:32:18.635 --> 00:32:20.936
When you hear this,

543
00:32:21.165 --> 00:32:22.635
please call me.

544
00:32:23.175 --> 00:32:25.306
Make sure you call me.

545
00:32:25.306 --> 00:32:26.675
Okay?

546
00:32:31.776 --> 00:32:33.115
(Cinderella)

547
00:32:39.286 --> 00:32:41.726
Hey. Did you know?

548
00:32:41.825 --> 00:32:43.196
Did you just find out?

549
00:32:43.496 --> 00:32:44.556
I found out last night...

550
00:32:44.556 --> 00:32:46.665
because Ji Soo barged into our home.

551
00:32:46.665 --> 00:32:47.796
Never mind that.

552
00:32:47.796 --> 00:32:49.466
About our agreement,

553
00:32:49.466 --> 00:32:51.236
let's call it off.

554
00:32:51.236 --> 00:32:52.466
Call it off?

555
00:32:52.466 --> 00:32:54.665
How can you do that? What can I do?

556
00:32:54.665 --> 00:32:55.966
Are you mad?

557
00:32:56.165 --> 00:32:58.635
Our families are like enemies to each other.

558
00:32:58.875 --> 00:33:00.446
Does it make sense for me to help you?

559
00:33:00.446 --> 00:33:02.675
My sister's gone missing.

560
00:33:02.946 --> 00:33:05.246
That's why you should help me.

561
00:33:05.246 --> 00:33:07.486
Think about what your parents did to us.

562
00:33:07.486 --> 00:33:09.286
If you are sorry, you should pay back.

563
00:33:31.276 --> 00:33:32.436
I wired the down payment.

564
00:33:32.946 --> 00:33:33.976
What?

565
00:33:33.976 --> 00:33:35.446
I already sent you the down payment.

566
00:33:35.446 --> 00:33:37.145
So you can't cancel it. Never.

567
00:33:37.145 --> 00:33:38.145
Hey.

568
00:33:38.145 --> 00:33:40.286
I will be done for if my family finds out.

569
00:33:40.286 --> 00:33:42.085
If I get into trouble too,

570
00:33:42.085 --> 00:33:44.286
my mother might kill me.

571
00:33:44.385 --> 00:33:46.286
How does that concern me?

572
00:33:46.286 --> 00:33:47.655
Please.

573
00:33:47.655 --> 00:33:49.956
I already did what you told me to do.

574
00:33:49.956 --> 00:33:51.796
You said a week was all you need.

575
00:33:51.796 --> 00:33:53.325
So I told Ryu...

576
00:33:53.325 --> 00:33:55.026
that I'd see him a week later with the money.

577
00:33:55.026 --> 00:33:57.165
I lied to Mother that Ryu is hurt.

578
00:33:57.466 --> 00:33:58.996
Lying to my mother is like...

579
00:33:58.996 --> 00:34:00.635
a death sentence.

580
00:34:01.065 --> 00:34:02.135
Please.

581
00:34:12.916 --> 00:34:15.016
From the contestants of the hand printing event...

582
00:34:15.016 --> 00:34:16.655
we held during the 40th anniversary event,

583
00:34:16.655 --> 00:34:18.786
we chose 10 finalists.

584
00:34:18.786 --> 00:34:20.556
The new winter jacket is launching soon,

585
00:34:20.556 --> 00:34:22.956
so the design team wants our answer today.

586
00:34:22.956 --> 00:34:25.255
You can write the scores on the score sheet.

587
00:34:25.726 --> 00:34:26.996
Our marketing strategy...

588
00:34:26.996 --> 00:34:29.095
is to gift fairytale-like emotions.

589
00:34:29.095 --> 00:34:31.465
It's important to express those emotions.

590
00:34:36.206 --> 00:34:38.306
(40th anniversary hand printing finalists)

591
00:35:03.436 --> 00:35:05.695
(Seo Ji An)

592
00:35:05.996 --> 00:35:08.365
(Successfully submitted)

593
00:35:38.865 --> 00:35:41.166
I think we need one here and one there.

594
00:35:41.166 --> 00:35:42.606
One there and one there.

595
00:35:43.336 --> 00:35:45.575
Is he the one...

596
00:35:46.505 --> 00:35:47.646
making the wood pillars?

597
00:35:52.246 --> 00:35:53.586
She said she severed all her connections.

598
00:35:55.746 --> 00:35:57.485
She must be preparing to go back to her life.

599
00:36:08.496 --> 00:36:10.896
Can you wait a week?

600
00:36:12.436 --> 00:36:15.005
I should've told you from the start.

601
00:36:15.936 --> 00:36:17.175
But right now,

602
00:36:18.206 --> 00:36:20.275
I don't have the strength to talk about it.

603
00:36:21.306 --> 00:36:23.075
She asked me to wait a week.

604
00:36:28.086 --> 00:36:30.186
You always keep your words.

605
00:36:30.786 --> 00:36:31.816
Right?

606
00:36:32.856 --> 00:36:33.956
Excuse me.

607
00:36:37.396 --> 00:36:39.126
I came to the right place.

608
00:36:39.126 --> 00:36:40.695
What brings you here?

609
00:36:40.695 --> 00:36:41.996
I need to talk to you.

610
00:36:56.175 --> 00:36:57.175
What is it you want to see me about?

611
00:36:57.175 --> 00:36:58.876
Do you know where Ji An is?

612
00:36:59.115 --> 00:37:00.545
Did you say Ji An?

613
00:37:01.215 --> 00:37:02.586
Why do you call her Ji An?

614
00:37:02.586 --> 00:37:04.255
I call her Ji An with good reason.

615
00:37:04.286 --> 00:37:05.715
What does that mean?

616
00:37:06.456 --> 00:37:07.856
It's none of your business.

617
00:37:08.126 --> 00:37:10.155
Just tell me if Ji An called you...

618
00:37:10.595 --> 00:37:11.695
or you met her.

619
00:37:15.066 --> 00:37:16.166
Who are you?

620
00:37:16.965 --> 00:37:18.465
I don't even know...

621
00:37:18.465 --> 00:37:21.436
your name or anything. Why would I tell you that?

622
00:37:21.436 --> 00:37:23.405
So do you know where she is or not?

623
00:37:23.505 --> 00:37:24.675
Well...

624
00:37:30.775 --> 00:37:31.945
I'm Choi Do Kyung.

625
00:37:35.545 --> 00:37:37.556
(Haesung Apparel, VP Choi Do Kyung)

626
00:37:40.325 --> 00:37:43.396
I returned to the Marketing Team.

627
00:37:45.556 --> 00:37:48.095
Do you know where Ji An is?

628
00:37:51.695 --> 00:37:53.836
- Mr. Sunwoo Hyuk. - I don't know.

629
00:37:54.505 --> 00:37:55.766
You don't?

630
00:37:57.376 --> 00:37:59.575
- I don't know. - It sounded like you did.

631
00:38:06.045 --> 00:38:09.286
I'm sorry, but she'll call me soon.

632
00:38:10.385 --> 00:38:12.985
She'll call you?

633
00:38:13.425 --> 00:38:17.195
Ji An said she'd tell me everything in a week.

634
00:38:17.755 --> 00:38:19.056
I'm sure she'll call me.

635
00:38:19.325 --> 00:38:21.465
I'll tell you once I hear from her.

636
00:38:22.166 --> 00:38:23.465
You think?

637
00:38:23.865 --> 00:38:25.436
She keeps her promises.

638
00:38:26.036 --> 00:38:27.436
I believe she will.

639
00:38:28.465 --> 00:38:29.465
All right then.

640
00:38:30.376 --> 00:38:31.536
Please call me.

641
00:38:32.536 --> 00:38:33.845
If Ji An calls you,

642
00:38:34.505 --> 00:38:35.976
please let me know...

643
00:38:37.215 --> 00:38:38.445
without telling her about it.

644
00:38:40.746 --> 00:38:41.885
Please.

645
00:39:00.206 --> 00:39:03.575
Did they get closer after a fight?

646
00:39:06.445 --> 00:39:08.545
Did he put her in the marketing team?

647
00:39:10.445 --> 00:39:11.916
Gosh, I hate that.

648
00:39:12.746 --> 00:39:15.646
I need at least a day's notice of cancellation.

649
00:39:15.646 --> 00:39:18.115
You can't cancel a meeting at the last moment.

650
00:39:18.516 --> 00:39:19.655
Hey.

651
00:39:20.525 --> 00:39:21.786
Why are you so depressed?

652
00:39:22.286 --> 00:39:23.525
Is the bulk order cancelled?

653
00:39:23.996 --> 00:39:25.295
In your company,

654
00:39:25.496 --> 00:39:28.465
can the owner's son date a female employee?

655
00:39:28.626 --> 00:39:29.936
He can date an employee...

656
00:39:30.635 --> 00:39:31.735
unless he gets caught.

657
00:39:32.465 --> 00:39:33.735
What if he gets caught?

658
00:39:34.606 --> 00:39:37.405
The owner wouldn't fire his son.

659
00:39:38.106 --> 00:39:39.606
But the employee wouldn't stay.

660
00:39:39.606 --> 00:39:41.246
That's ridiculous.

661
00:39:41.345 --> 00:39:43.115
So they fire her just like that?

662
00:39:43.115 --> 00:39:44.416
They both loved each other.

663
00:39:45.016 --> 00:39:46.316
Do you watch a drama these days?

664
00:39:47.316 --> 00:39:48.516
A company owner's son...

665
00:39:48.516 --> 00:39:51.186
is looking for an ordinary girl.

666
00:39:51.556 --> 00:39:53.255
The girl was an employee of his company.

667
00:39:53.385 --> 00:39:56.086
They dated and got caught. It got messy.

668
00:39:56.226 --> 00:39:58.726
She couldn't stand what she had to go through.

669
00:39:58.726 --> 00:40:00.425
So he's looking for her.

670
00:40:00.825 --> 00:40:01.925
That's what it is.

671
00:40:02.226 --> 00:40:03.295
Is that it?

672
00:40:03.666 --> 00:40:05.166
That's fairly common in our world.

673
00:40:05.996 --> 00:40:07.066
And there's no exception.

674
00:40:07.905 --> 00:40:08.965
But why?

675
00:40:11.275 --> 00:40:12.306
Nothing.

676
00:40:34.996 --> 00:40:36.095
Ji Soo.

677
00:40:37.735 --> 00:40:38.766
What?

678
00:40:43.876 --> 00:40:45.106
Hello?

679
00:40:45.476 --> 00:40:46.606
It's me. Dad.

680
00:40:48.106 --> 00:40:49.646
Dad?

681
00:40:50.646 --> 00:40:52.316
Yes, it's me.

682
00:41:01.525 --> 00:41:03.956
I'm sorry. I thought you were someone else.

683
00:41:05.755 --> 00:41:06.925
I see.

684
00:41:07.425 --> 00:41:08.595
It's all right.

685
00:41:09.226 --> 00:41:10.635
What's the matter?

686
00:41:11.566 --> 00:41:13.336
Let's have dinner together tonight.

687
00:41:14.706 --> 00:41:16.106
Okay.

688
00:41:20.945 --> 00:41:23.845
Are you the one who took my daughter away twice?

689
00:41:24.215 --> 00:41:25.945
- Sir. - Don't you dare kneel.

690
00:41:27.786 --> 00:41:29.816
Repenting after getting caught isn't genuine.

691
00:41:30.056 --> 00:41:31.885
You two...

692
00:41:32.816 --> 00:41:35.086
will pay for your crimes. So don't you...

693
00:41:35.385 --> 00:41:36.825
dare say another word.

694
00:41:48.336 --> 00:41:50.476
You must be disappointed that Do Kyung isn't here.

695
00:41:50.836 --> 00:41:51.936
It's okay.

696
00:41:52.005 --> 00:41:54.945
Ji Soo, you can't put your elbows on the table.

697
00:41:55.376 --> 00:41:56.416
Why not?

698
00:41:56.516 --> 00:41:58.045
It's table manners.

699
00:41:59.016 --> 00:42:00.845
Is there such a thing?

700
00:42:01.045 --> 00:42:03.286
- Of course. - Where?

701
00:42:07.485 --> 00:42:09.025
You can't see it, but it's a thing.

702
00:42:09.485 --> 00:42:12.965
So sit straight and remove your arms from the table.

703
00:42:14.226 --> 00:42:16.465
Why should I do that when I can't even see it?

704
00:42:16.936 --> 00:42:19.865
I'm just eating because the food is good.

705
00:42:20.106 --> 00:42:22.606
Then can't I just eat it the way I'm comfortable?

706
00:42:23.235 --> 00:42:25.806
That's what you did with the other family.

707
00:42:26.275 --> 00:42:28.646
- But it's different here. - What's different?

708
00:42:29.345 --> 00:42:30.775
Don't answer back.

709
00:42:30.775 --> 00:42:31.845
Hey.

710
00:42:32.775 --> 00:42:35.246
I'm not talking back. I'm having a conversation.

711
00:42:36.016 --> 00:42:37.086
Well...

712
00:42:37.556 --> 00:42:39.016
Just let her eat the way she wants.

713
00:42:39.655 --> 00:42:42.556
I don't feel like eating already.

714
00:42:42.925 --> 00:42:44.255
I'll eat alone later.

715
00:42:44.396 --> 00:42:45.425
Ji Soo.

716
00:42:46.525 --> 00:42:48.325
Why are you acting upset?

717
00:42:48.425 --> 00:42:49.766
Because I'm upset.

718
00:42:50.836 --> 00:42:53.735
Even if you are, you can't take it out on anyone.

719
00:42:53.735 --> 00:42:55.965
I'm upset, but if I don't take out my anger,

720
00:42:55.965 --> 00:42:57.306
what am I supposed to do with it?

721
00:42:57.735 --> 00:42:59.505
I should take out my anger to release it.

722
00:43:00.345 --> 00:43:02.075
And you are not just anyone.

723
00:43:02.146 --> 00:43:04.345
Then are you taking out your anger on us now?

724
00:43:05.075 --> 00:43:06.715
- Yes. - Why?

725
00:43:06.945 --> 00:43:07.985
Seo Hyun.

726
00:43:07.985 --> 00:43:10.385
Because your parents lost me.

727
00:43:10.655 --> 00:43:12.115
It was an accident.

728
00:43:12.115 --> 00:43:13.626
It can't be an accident.

729
00:43:14.686 --> 00:43:16.025
Was it an accident?

730
00:43:18.325 --> 00:43:19.556
It was an accident.

731
00:43:20.425 --> 00:43:23.066
Your mom passed out after a car accident.

732
00:43:23.066 --> 00:43:24.235
That's when she lost you.

733
00:43:24.235 --> 00:43:25.436
That's not true.

734
00:43:26.405 --> 00:43:28.135
I read some articles.

735
00:43:29.876 --> 00:43:31.175
I can't believe this.

736
00:43:32.306 --> 00:43:35.646
Why'd you let a 3-year-old girl wear a diamond pin?

737
00:43:36.045 --> 00:43:37.845
That's why you lost me.

738
00:43:41.786 --> 00:43:42.816
Don't you think?

739
00:43:43.186 --> 00:43:45.556
You see bread when you're hungry. Would you eat it?

740
00:43:47.325 --> 00:43:48.525
I would.

741
00:43:48.786 --> 00:43:50.095
She would eat it.

742
00:43:50.325 --> 00:43:52.695
The pin had pink diamonds on it.

743
00:43:54.795 --> 00:43:56.896
We always traveled by car.

744
00:43:57.235 --> 00:43:58.536
It wasn't dangerous.

745
00:43:58.635 --> 00:43:59.965
But you had an accident.

746
00:44:00.635 --> 00:44:02.465
And why did you take Ji An...

747
00:44:02.465 --> 00:44:04.275
only after talking with my mom?

748
00:44:04.936 --> 00:44:07.376
You should've done another DNA test.

749
00:44:09.445 --> 00:44:11.476
I'm sorry about that.

750
00:44:11.476 --> 00:44:14.146
Then you shouldn't treat my parents like that.

751
00:44:14.146 --> 00:44:16.016
You people are just as responsible.

752
00:44:16.316 --> 00:44:18.115
Your mother lied to me.

753
00:44:18.485 --> 00:44:21.686
It's your parents who sent Ji An and deceived us.

754
00:44:24.095 --> 00:44:25.095
Myung Hee.

755
00:44:25.095 --> 00:44:27.266
If you hadn't lost me in the first place,

756
00:44:27.825 --> 00:44:30.295
my parents wouldn't have had to lie to you.

757
00:44:31.135 --> 00:44:32.836
My birth mother lost me,

758
00:44:33.166 --> 00:44:35.306
and my foster mother sent Ji An instead of me.

759
00:44:35.306 --> 00:44:37.036
You both are to blame. So...

760
00:44:38.575 --> 00:44:41.005
I'm only one who can get angry with my parents.

761
00:44:41.376 --> 00:44:43.045
I'm the only one who has the right to hate them.

762
00:44:44.416 --> 00:44:46.246
You shouldn't have lost me in the first place.

763
00:44:54.825 --> 00:44:55.856
Tell me.

764
00:44:56.556 --> 00:44:58.556
How did you kidnap my daughter...

765
00:44:59.295 --> 00:45:01.126
in Yangpyeong rest area?

766
00:45:03.595 --> 00:45:05.566
I can tell you that.

767
00:45:06.965 --> 00:45:09.235
But if you were more cautious,

768
00:45:10.405 --> 00:45:12.005
you wouldn't have lost your daughter,

769
00:45:12.775 --> 00:45:14.775
and we would've gotten caught immediately.

770
00:46:08.896 --> 00:46:10.195
Who is she?

771
00:46:13.135 --> 00:46:14.166
These are...

772
00:46:14.865 --> 00:46:17.976
diamonds. They're pink diamonds.

773
00:46:17.976 --> 00:46:19.905
Pink diamonds?

774
00:46:21.445 --> 00:46:24.376
Can I take a look at your hairpin?

775
00:46:37.155 --> 00:46:40.965
Mommy will be back soon. Wait for her in the car.

776
00:47:11.095 --> 00:47:12.965
Nothing she said is wrong.

777
00:47:13.865 --> 00:47:16.025
That's why she blames us.

778
00:47:19.606 --> 00:47:20.965
Let's be lenient on...

779
00:47:21.066 --> 00:47:22.135
Seo Tae Soo and Yang Mi Jung.

780
00:47:22.405 --> 00:47:24.635
We should just let them be?

781
00:47:24.635 --> 00:47:26.135
When they deceived us?

782
00:47:26.746 --> 00:47:29.146
Should we go along with that immature child?

783
00:47:29.715 --> 00:47:30.876
I can't do that.

784
00:47:30.876 --> 00:47:32.215
You want to do more than...

785
00:47:32.215 --> 00:47:33.746
forcing Yang Mi Jung to work...

786
00:47:33.746 --> 00:47:35.045
and keeping her on a leash?

787
00:47:35.345 --> 00:47:37.255
It'll hurt us if they turn themselves in.

788
00:47:37.856 --> 00:47:39.516
I can't just let this go.

789
00:47:39.516 --> 00:47:41.325
Let's think of the real Eun Seok.

790
00:47:41.456 --> 00:47:42.726
You saw her reaction.

791
00:47:43.195 --> 00:47:44.325
That's only because...

792
00:47:44.325 --> 00:47:46.465
she doesn't know where she is.

793
00:47:47.396 --> 00:47:48.626
Before we do anything,

794
00:47:48.626 --> 00:47:50.936
I should go to Hawaii to see my father.

795
00:47:51.336 --> 00:47:53.206
If we agreed to blame it on a mistake,

796
00:47:53.206 --> 00:47:54.965
you can tell him over the phone.

797
00:47:56.206 --> 00:47:57.476
I can't.

798
00:47:57.575 --> 00:47:59.135
I must tell him in person...

799
00:47:59.135 --> 00:48:00.675
so that he gets less disappointed.

800
00:48:01.005 --> 00:48:03.345
Are you hoping that he will...

801
00:48:03.345 --> 00:48:05.175
come up with a story?

802
00:48:06.316 --> 00:48:07.485
No.

803
00:48:09.485 --> 00:48:10.856
I can't let him...

804
00:48:11.316 --> 00:48:13.525
end up favoring Jin Hee over me.

805
00:48:22.325 --> 00:48:23.496
How incredible.

806
00:48:27.936 --> 00:48:29.976
This is one impressive household.

807
00:49:03.936 --> 00:49:06.075
Please leave a message.

808
00:49:10.376 --> 00:49:11.376
Seo Ji An.

809
00:49:12.416 --> 00:49:13.445
Ji An.

810
00:49:16.686 --> 00:49:18.985
Is that why you couldn't tell me?

811
00:49:18.985 --> 00:49:20.126
Because of him?

812
00:49:22.925 --> 00:49:24.025
Fine.

813
00:49:24.655 --> 00:49:26.095
Now I get it.

814
00:49:26.365 --> 00:49:28.726
I totally get why you went into hiding.

815
00:49:32.036 --> 00:49:33.266
But still, I said...

816
00:49:33.606 --> 00:49:35.505
you can come to me if you need help.

817
00:49:35.865 --> 00:49:37.036
I'll just listen,

818
00:49:37.036 --> 00:49:38.275
no questions asked.

819
00:49:38.275 --> 00:49:40.045
Why are you suffering alone?

820
00:49:42.045 --> 00:49:43.445
Get back to me.

821
00:49:44.075 --> 00:49:45.476
You may break promises,

822
00:49:45.476 --> 00:49:46.885
but you know I don't.

823
00:49:47.485 --> 00:49:49.655
I can do anything for a friend.

824
00:49:49.655 --> 00:49:51.056
You know that, right?

825
00:49:54.056 --> 00:49:55.186
Welcome.

826
00:50:11.536 --> 00:50:12.905
Oh dear.

827
00:50:13.476 --> 00:50:15.405
There are no empty tables.

828
00:50:15.905 --> 00:50:17.246
I just wanted a drink.

829
00:50:17.675 --> 00:50:18.876
Join me.

830
00:50:23.615 --> 00:50:25.416
But don't talk to me.

831
00:50:26.985 --> 00:50:27.985
Me too.

832
00:50:29.255 --> 00:50:31.056
Can I have another bottle?

833
00:50:31.155 --> 00:50:32.155
Me too.

834
00:51:03.996 --> 00:51:05.056
Hey.

835
00:51:05.595 --> 00:51:07.525
How many times have you been in love?

836
00:51:12.365 --> 00:51:13.405
Once.

837
00:51:34.155 --> 00:51:36.126
Why does he have such long legs?

838
00:51:37.925 --> 00:51:39.496
Save me.

839
00:51:41.626 --> 00:51:42.695
Hyuk?

840
00:51:45.635 --> 00:51:47.766
I'm here to deliver Sunwoo Hyuk.

841
00:51:49.306 --> 00:51:50.936
What happened?

842
00:51:54.476 --> 00:51:55.775
He's killing me.

843
00:51:56.746 --> 00:51:59.075
Why are you bringing him home?

844
00:51:59.075 --> 00:52:00.885
My back's about to break.

845
00:52:00.885 --> 00:52:01.945
Let's put him down.

846
00:52:01.945 --> 00:52:04.255
Put him down here. I'll take him upstairs.

847
00:52:04.255 --> 00:52:06.155
He's way too heavy.

848
00:52:06.155 --> 00:52:08.356
- Just put him down. - No.

849
00:52:09.556 --> 00:52:11.155
Oh dear.

850
00:52:11.655 --> 00:52:13.865
Hee, are you okay?

851
00:52:13.865 --> 00:52:14.996
Are you okay?

852
00:52:14.996 --> 00:52:16.936
I'm fine, so get out of here.

853
00:52:16.936 --> 00:52:17.965
Get out.

854
00:52:17.965 --> 00:52:20.066
- How will you manage... - There's another guy.

855
00:52:20.066 --> 00:52:21.836
Get out. Get out right now!

856
00:52:21.836 --> 00:52:23.675
Okay, but my shoes...

857
00:52:25.436 --> 00:52:27.675
Hyuk, wake up.

858
00:52:27.706 --> 00:52:29.675
Hyuk. Oh no...

859
00:52:29.675 --> 00:52:31.916
- Hyuk. - What a mess.

860
00:52:47.226 --> 00:52:48.896
Why did she disappear...

861
00:52:48.896 --> 00:52:50.635
without calling anyone?

862
00:52:52.836 --> 00:52:54.405
I don't believe it.

863
00:52:54.405 --> 00:52:56.066
I got to see you drunk.

864
00:52:57.306 --> 00:52:58.635
Answer me.

865
00:52:59.135 --> 00:53:00.675
You're smart.

866
00:53:01.175 --> 00:53:03.215
Come up with a reason.

867
00:53:03.545 --> 00:53:04.675
Choi Do Kyung.

868
00:53:05.345 --> 00:53:07.146
Are you letting yourself go?

869
00:53:07.246 --> 00:53:08.845
Get a grip of your emotions.

870
00:53:09.086 --> 00:53:10.586
Don't you worry.

871
00:53:12.416 --> 00:53:13.825
These emotions...

872
00:53:14.525 --> 00:53:16.655
are not those kinds of emotions.

873
00:53:17.996 --> 00:53:20.695
I'm upset because I can't keep a promise.

874
00:53:22.896 --> 00:53:23.965
She...

875
00:53:25.266 --> 00:53:26.536
Ji An...

876
00:53:28.566 --> 00:53:30.675
ran away because she was scared.

877
00:53:32.476 --> 00:53:33.575
Why?

878
00:53:35.405 --> 00:53:37.545
Because I didn't help her.

879
00:53:38.746 --> 00:53:41.215
I should've helped her.

880
00:53:42.545 --> 00:53:44.916
I said I would and I didn't.

881
00:53:45.356 --> 00:53:47.126
What a piece of work.

882
00:53:47.925 --> 00:53:50.056
He's drunk and he still won't give the full story.

883
00:53:52.425 --> 00:53:54.126
I'm so worried.

884
00:53:58.365 --> 00:53:59.606
I'm going crazy.

885
00:54:02.505 --> 00:54:03.836
I'm so worried.

886
00:54:26.795 --> 00:54:28.025
What are you doing?

887
00:54:28.195 --> 00:54:29.325
Oh, right.

888
00:55:10.306 --> 00:55:12.036
Thank you very much.

889
00:56:36.496 --> 00:56:38.626
(Bakery guy)

890
00:56:41.496 --> 00:56:42.525
Hello.

891
00:56:42.525 --> 00:56:43.536
Hey.

892
00:56:44.066 --> 00:56:46.706
Aren't you going to Incheon today?

893
00:56:46.836 --> 00:56:48.206
How did you know that?

894
00:56:48.206 --> 00:56:50.675
You said you'd get some nice wood...

895
00:56:50.836 --> 00:56:53.575
and make me a bread board.

896
00:56:53.575 --> 00:56:54.675
I did?

897
00:57:00.746 --> 00:57:02.215
When you carried me home?

898
00:57:03.385 --> 00:57:05.155
I'm getting some nice wood.

899
00:57:05.255 --> 00:57:06.356
I'll make you one.

900
00:57:07.485 --> 00:57:09.795
Forget about that.

901
00:57:10.626 --> 00:57:12.996
- Do me a favor. - What is it?

902
00:57:14.195 --> 00:57:16.836
Those people are so careless.

903
00:57:17.436 --> 00:57:18.536
Why?

904
00:57:18.836 --> 00:57:20.106
We're done for the day.

905
00:57:21.536 --> 00:57:24.436
We're out of bay salt, and we can't bake.

906
00:57:24.505 --> 00:57:26.106
What a disaster.

907
00:57:26.445 --> 00:57:29.775
The men bringing the salt died...

908
00:57:29.945 --> 00:57:32.316
They're badly hurt.

909
00:57:34.115 --> 00:57:35.945
I'll go to the store and get some.

910
00:57:35.945 --> 00:57:38.086
When did I ever use salt from the store?

911
00:57:39.316 --> 00:57:41.456
You need to go to Incheon.

912
00:57:41.456 --> 00:57:42.726
To Incheon?

913
00:57:42.825 --> 00:57:44.456
I can't drive.

914
00:57:45.356 --> 00:57:49.525
Mr. Sunwoo's going to a sawmill in Incheon.

915
00:57:49.635 --> 00:57:51.396
I begged for his help.

916
00:57:51.396 --> 00:57:53.235
To get us some salt.

917
00:57:54.306 --> 00:57:55.936
Mr. Sunwoo?

918
00:57:56.235 --> 00:57:59.476
Yes. I'll go and run some personal errands.

919
00:57:59.775 --> 00:58:01.405
Go and get some air.

920
00:58:01.405 --> 00:58:03.175
And comfort Mr. Sunwoo.

921
00:58:03.516 --> 00:58:05.075
Comfort him for what?

922
00:58:05.945 --> 00:58:09.885
I happened to meet him at a bar a few days ago.

923
00:58:10.456 --> 00:58:12.356
I think he's moping over a lost love.

924
00:58:12.356 --> 00:58:14.155
- Gosh. - He liked this woman,

925
00:58:14.456 --> 00:58:16.226
but she was seeing someone else.

926
00:58:17.525 --> 00:58:19.525
You can't hear the story without shedding a tear.

927
00:58:20.295 --> 00:58:21.666
Oh dear.

928
00:58:33.306 --> 00:58:34.575
Hello.

929
00:58:34.876 --> 00:58:35.945
Hello.

930
00:58:38.575 --> 00:58:39.715
Get in.

931
00:58:51.525 --> 00:58:53.925
Are you bored? Shall we listen to music?

932
00:58:53.925 --> 00:58:55.095
Not...

933
00:58:56.166 --> 00:58:57.235
Okay.

934
00:58:57.965 --> 00:58:59.195
What music do you like?

935
00:58:59.336 --> 00:59:02.005
Anything. Play whatever you want.

936
00:59:02.005 --> 00:59:03.235
I don't mind.

937
00:59:10.775 --> 00:59:12.215
Do you not like this genre?

938
00:59:15.215 --> 00:59:17.086
Cheer up. Bye.

939
00:59:18.916 --> 00:59:20.286
Cheer up.

940
00:59:20.755 --> 00:59:22.925
You don't look too good.

941
00:59:25.095 --> 00:59:27.295
You're saying what I said to you.

942
00:59:29.066 --> 00:59:30.266
Did you ever feel that...

943
00:59:30.996 --> 00:59:33.405
you knew someone very well,

944
00:59:33.706 --> 00:59:35.806
but you actually knew next to nothing?

945
00:59:37.905 --> 00:59:39.206
Even your family...

946
00:59:40.345 --> 00:59:42.045
doesn't know everything.

947
00:59:42.876 --> 00:59:45.215
Why did I make conclusions about that person?

948
00:59:45.876 --> 00:59:47.345
Why did I think I knew the person?

949
00:59:48.416 --> 00:59:49.416
I regret that.

950
00:59:50.215 --> 00:59:51.885
Because they never told you.

951
00:59:53.226 --> 00:59:54.686
You can't know how one feels...

952
00:59:54.885 --> 00:59:57.056
unless they tell you.

953
00:59:58.655 --> 01:00:02.266
You can never see into someone else's mind.

954
01:00:07.735 --> 01:00:09.706
It's nothing, I just...

955
01:00:10.735 --> 01:00:11.936
You're eloquent.

956
01:00:12.836 --> 01:00:14.945
What? I am?

957
01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:16.646
I'm quite chatty.

958
01:00:17.445 --> 01:00:18.675
That's not what I meant.

959
01:00:20.186 --> 01:00:21.286
Then what?

960
01:00:21.286 --> 01:00:23.056
I must really have something.

961
01:00:23.916 --> 01:00:25.516
I became a breadwinner at a young age,

962
01:00:25.516 --> 01:00:27.385
so I had to make all the decisions.

963
01:00:28.025 --> 01:00:30.856
I quickly form something like a prejudice.

964
01:00:32.155 --> 01:00:33.595
It's a very bad habit.

965
01:00:34.465 --> 01:00:36.666
I don't get what you mean.

966
01:00:36.996 --> 01:00:39.806
I'll tell you if we get closer, neighbor.

967
01:01:38.295 --> 01:01:40.525
We'll do it. What if you get hurt?

968
01:01:42.325 --> 01:01:43.766
It is your girlfriend this time, right?

969
01:01:43.766 --> 01:01:45.996
No, we're just neighbors.

970
01:01:45.996 --> 01:01:47.066
Neighbors?

971
01:01:47.336 --> 01:01:49.106
Oh, a female friend?

972
01:01:49.405 --> 01:01:53.345
Why do you have so many pretty female friends?

973
01:01:53.606 --> 01:01:56.775
Stop talking nonsense and show me some rosewood.

974
01:01:57.115 --> 01:01:58.215
Sure.

975
01:01:58.916 --> 01:02:00.045
I won't be long.

976
01:02:00.385 --> 01:02:01.516
Okay.

977
01:02:09.956 --> 01:02:12.695
Ji An used to love wood.

978
01:02:34.719 --> 01:02:39.719
<font face="Papyrus" color="#00ff00">Subtitle ripped and resynced by redixion</font>

979
01:03:00.445 --> 01:03:02.505
Is this the cafe owner's favorite store?

980
01:03:02.806 --> 01:03:04.816
It tastes best when made the traditional way.

981
01:03:04.816 --> 01:03:06.845
She makes me come here every year.

982
01:03:07.686 --> 01:03:08.816
How fascinating.

983
01:03:17.396 --> 01:03:18.595
Ji Soo.

984
01:03:19.666 --> 01:03:21.095
Do you want some squid?

985
01:03:21.095 --> 01:03:22.626
No, I'm fine.

986
01:03:23.235 --> 01:03:25.396
That's how they dry seaweed.

987
01:03:25.896 --> 01:03:27.666
I should come back to look around.

988
01:03:36.816 --> 01:03:39.115
- Ji Soo, let's go. - Okay.

989
01:04:01.365 --> 01:04:03.876
I didn't think you'd buy some for me.

990
01:04:04.135 --> 01:04:05.905
I couldn't ask you, could I?

991
01:04:06.175 --> 01:04:08.545
I'll treat you to a meal back in Seoul.

992
01:04:09.275 --> 01:04:11.075
I hope you will.

993
01:04:12.016 --> 01:04:13.286
I should.

994
01:04:29.126 --> 01:04:30.195
Sorry.

995
01:04:30.365 --> 01:04:31.836
Take a taxi back.

996
01:04:32.635 --> 01:04:33.706
What?

997
01:04:34.465 --> 01:04:37.836
I need to make a stop. I'll bring you the salt.

998
01:04:50.385 --> 01:04:52.255
- Drive safely. - Sure.

999
01:05:07.005 --> 01:05:08.436
What's wrong?

1000
01:05:21.146 --> 01:05:23.316
Could you turn back?

1001
01:06:26.385 --> 01:06:27.545
Ji An.
