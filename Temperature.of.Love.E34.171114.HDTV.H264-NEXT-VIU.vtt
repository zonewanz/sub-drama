00:00:06.953 --> 00:00:08.623
(Episode 34)

2
00:00:29.913 --> 00:00:31.343
(Yeon Woo's living room)

3
00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:37.273
What are you doing there?

4
00:02:40.203 --> 00:02:41.243
I'm sorry.

5
00:02:42.072 --> 00:02:44.782
I came in here to turn the lights off.

6
00:02:44.942 --> 00:02:47.012
You hate paying too much electricity bill.

7
00:02:50.382 --> 00:02:53.023
But you earn money and pay the bill yourself,

8
00:02:53.623 --> 00:02:56.593
so it's okay to leave the lights on all night, isn't it?

9
00:02:57.662 --> 00:02:58.792
Do you want some coffee?

10
00:03:00.632 --> 00:03:01.692
Wait.

11
00:03:02.993 --> 00:03:04.232
Is it too late for coffee?

12
00:03:05.403 --> 00:03:07.102
No, it doesn't matter.

13
00:03:10.773 --> 00:03:12.002
Did you go somewhere?

14
00:03:17.583 --> 00:03:19.643
I met with the CEO of Park Jin Soo's management.

15
00:03:20.683 --> 00:03:22.953
I gave him your drama synopsis.

16
00:03:23.583 --> 00:03:24.683
He seemed positive about it.

17
00:03:25.683 --> 00:03:27.053
Aren't you tired?

18
00:03:28.053 --> 00:03:29.093
Why do you say that?

19
00:03:30.692 --> 00:03:32.792
Because you're everyone's problem solver.

20
00:03:33.292 --> 00:03:35.792
You make others happy.

21
00:03:36.593 --> 00:03:38.803
But what about you?

22
00:03:39.363 --> 00:03:42.333
I'm used to being alone and solving problems.

23
00:03:42.933 --> 00:03:45.472
But you aren't used to communicating.

24
00:03:49.012 --> 00:03:52.583
You get on an elevator when you're going up on a tall building.

25
00:03:53.982 --> 00:03:56.382
As I went up floor by floor,

26
00:03:57.523 --> 00:03:59.083
a lot of people got off.

27
00:03:59.653 --> 00:04:01.593
Sometimes I pushed people off the elevator.

28
00:04:04.762 --> 00:04:07.093
When I got to the top, I was the only one left.

29
00:04:11.203 --> 00:04:12.833
People are alone in the end.

30
00:04:14.002 --> 00:04:16.072
They are, but they can't live alone.

31
00:04:16.703 --> 00:04:19.403
Loving someone deeply makes you very lonely.

32
00:04:20.172 --> 00:04:21.273
I don't like that.

33
00:04:23.172 --> 00:04:24.542
I agree.

34
00:04:29.552 --> 00:04:31.722
We haven't agreed on something in so long.

35
00:04:32.383 --> 00:04:33.523
Is it still a happy ending?

36
00:04:35.693 --> 00:04:36.893
I'm not sure.

37
00:04:39.093 --> 00:04:41.032
It's closer to a sad ending now.

38
00:04:42.162 --> 00:04:43.333
It is.

39
00:07:50.953 --> 00:07:53.992
(Lee Hyun Soo)

40
00:07:58.323 --> 00:07:59.792
(Jung Sun)

41
00:08:01.362 --> 00:08:03.133
(Jung Sun)

42
00:08:06.003 --> 00:08:08.172
(Accept)

43
00:08:11.273 --> 00:08:12.542
Yes, Jung Sun.

44
00:08:13.872 --> 00:08:15.242
Can we meet?

45
00:08:40.933 --> 00:08:42.132
It's been a while.

46
00:08:43.972 --> 00:08:45.043
It's been a while.

47
00:08:52.012 --> 00:08:53.913
I asked to see you because I have something to say.

48
00:08:56.882 --> 00:09:00.122
I decided to accept an offer to become a head chef in Hong Kong.

49
00:09:01.392 --> 00:09:02.453
Is that a good thing?

50
00:09:03.252 --> 00:09:06.362
The conditions are good, so it's a very good thing.

51
00:09:07.693 --> 00:09:08.862
Congratulations.

52
00:09:09.693 --> 00:09:11.262
I knew it'd work out for you.

53
00:09:12.902 --> 00:09:15.902
When I go, I'll have to focus on it for at least six months.

54
00:09:21.112 --> 00:09:22.213
Will you come with me?

55
00:09:30.923 --> 00:09:33.183
If we're together somewhere else,

56
00:09:34.293 --> 00:09:37.093
maybe we might be able to go back to how we were.

57
00:09:46.732 --> 00:09:48.573
I don't know what it means...

58
00:09:51.173 --> 00:09:53.073
to go back to how we were.

59
00:09:58.583 --> 00:09:59.612
I'm sorry.

60
00:10:05.053 --> 00:10:06.053
It's okay.

61
00:11:01.913 --> 00:11:03.372
You look lonely.

62
00:11:04.612 --> 00:11:07.453
Do you feel restless now that you've made up your mind about Hong Kong?

63
00:11:10.953 --> 00:11:12.122
Is it really over...

64
00:11:13.022 --> 00:11:14.293
with Hyun Soo?

65
00:11:15.752 --> 00:11:16.823
Won Joon.

66
00:11:17.593 --> 00:11:19.163
Do you want to drink tonight?

67
00:11:21.093 --> 00:11:23.163
What brings such a busy person here?

68
00:11:23.762 --> 00:11:24.862
Are you teasing me?

69
00:11:25.333 --> 00:11:27.972
Didn't you hear my drama might be delayed because of Hyun Soo's?

70
00:11:28.402 --> 00:11:30.173
But it's still in progress.

71
00:11:30.173 --> 00:11:31.343
It should be.

72
00:11:31.843 --> 00:11:34.972
I just dropped by before seeing Mr. Park.

73
00:11:35.413 --> 00:11:37.642
- Why? - To get myself fired up...

74
00:11:37.913 --> 00:11:39.443
while seeing how well Hyun Soo is doing.

75
00:11:39.612 --> 00:11:41.913
She's not doing well at all.

76
00:11:42.183 --> 00:11:43.512
She's depressed these days.

77
00:11:43.923 --> 00:11:44.953
Why?

78
00:11:45.522 --> 00:11:47.622
She broke up with Chef On.

79
00:11:47.622 --> 00:11:48.752
They broke up?

80
00:11:50.522 --> 00:11:52.193
After all that fuss?

81
00:11:53.293 --> 00:11:55.433
Love really doesn't amount to much.

82
00:12:10.457 --> 00:12:14.957
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E34 Temperature of Love "I'm Going to Hong Kong"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

83
00:12:30.063 --> 00:12:31.102
Gosh, it smells.

84
00:12:33.872 --> 00:12:35.333
What is all this?

85
00:12:36.073 --> 00:12:37.242
Did something happen?

86
00:12:38.372 --> 00:12:39.843
Nothing happened.

87
00:12:41.142 --> 00:12:43.142
I've never seen you like this.

88
00:12:47.652 --> 00:12:49.783
This is how I look when I've been dumped.

89
00:12:52.823 --> 00:12:54.122
Did you break up with Hyun Soo?

90
00:12:57.593 --> 00:12:58.622
Forget it.

91
00:12:59.122 --> 00:13:01.732
Don't stop someone from leaving.

92
00:13:01.833 --> 00:13:02.862
It's the best way.

93
00:13:05.303 --> 00:13:07.533
You'll feel better after you get some rest.

94
00:13:15.043 --> 00:13:16.713
Did you break up with Jung Sun?

95
00:13:18.843 --> 00:13:20.183
What I'm curious about...

96
00:13:20.913 --> 00:13:22.313
is why you broke up with him.

97
00:13:22.882 --> 00:13:25.553
Jung Sun would never break up with you.

98
00:13:26.522 --> 00:13:28.252
You said you'd accept me.

99
00:13:28.892 --> 00:13:31.262
I'm the biggest flaw for Jung Sun.

100
00:13:31.463 --> 00:13:32.862
He's a great guy.

101
00:13:34.333 --> 00:13:36.392
I don't think of you as a flaw.

102
00:13:38.033 --> 00:13:41.433
It was just a problem between Jung Sun and me.

103
00:13:43.132 --> 00:13:45.843
Not a flaw, but something we share.

104
00:13:46.642 --> 00:13:47.872
Gong Yoo is an actor.

105
00:13:48.543 --> 00:13:50.482
What does he have anything to do with Jung Sun?

106
00:13:51.012 --> 00:13:53.813
Don't tell me you're dating him.

107
00:13:53.813 --> 00:13:55.213
- Mother... - What?

108
00:13:55.583 --> 00:13:57.722
- Are you really? - No, it's not like that.

109
00:13:58.553 --> 00:13:59.622
No, right?

110
00:14:02.093 --> 00:14:03.122
Just have your tea.

111
00:14:05.522 --> 00:14:07.232
Since it's over between you two,

112
00:14:07.933 --> 00:14:10.093
does that mean we'll never see each other again?

113
00:14:11.132 --> 00:14:14.033
No, we can still meet up.

114
00:14:14.803 --> 00:14:17.772
Jung Sun is moving to Hong Kong. He was scouted on a good deal.

115
00:14:20.512 --> 00:14:23.713
He might change his mind if he lives somewhere else.

116
00:14:24.343 --> 00:14:27.313
Women would never let a young and competent man alone.

117
00:14:28.453 --> 00:14:30.982
Doesn't it make you mad when I say something like this?

118
00:14:32.022 --> 00:14:33.252
A little bit.

119
00:14:34.152 --> 00:14:35.222
I'm glad.

120
00:14:36.323 --> 00:14:38.793
If you're too comfortable after letting my son go,

121
00:14:38.963 --> 00:14:40.533
it would make me upset.

122
00:14:41.262 --> 00:14:42.463
He's leaving next week.

123
00:14:52.372 --> 00:14:53.742
I'm here, Mr. Park.

124
00:15:00.612 --> 00:15:02.152
What is it that you wanted to talk about?

125
00:15:03.313 --> 00:15:06.553
If you're trying to persuade me, don't.

126
00:15:06.953 --> 00:15:08.553
I won't step back.

127
00:15:08.722 --> 00:15:09.852
Don't.

128
00:15:10.563 --> 00:15:11.693
Don't?

129
00:15:11.693 --> 00:15:14.463
You have a good reason for your complaint.

130
00:15:14.693 --> 00:15:16.333
Although it'll be hard for the company.

131
00:15:17.362 --> 00:15:19.703
You and Hyun Soo have different characteristics,

132
00:15:19.902 --> 00:15:22.002
and one of you is on cable.

133
00:15:22.772 --> 00:15:24.372
I decided it'd be worth a try.

134
00:15:25.843 --> 00:15:28.343
It's what I deserve, so I won't thank you.

135
00:15:29.713 --> 00:15:30.813
What about casting?

136
00:15:31.382 --> 00:15:33.882
Director Min is contacting a few stars.

137
00:15:34.382 --> 00:15:35.683
Actors way past their heydays?

138
00:15:35.683 --> 00:15:37.252
They're still gems.

139
00:15:37.423 --> 00:15:39.022
You should be thankful if they accept.

140
00:15:40.323 --> 00:15:42.953
All right. I'll get going.

141
00:15:45.492 --> 00:15:46.522
Right.

142
00:15:48.392 --> 00:15:51.203
Did you know Hyun Soo broke up with Jung Sun?

143
00:15:54.933 --> 00:15:57.102
It's your chance now.

144
00:15:58.772 --> 00:16:00.543
I don't rob empty houses.

145
00:16:01.142 --> 00:16:02.573
("Kind Soup Will Not Pick up His Calls")

146
00:16:03.512 --> 00:16:04.982
Did Son Ye Jin call us back?

147
00:16:05.583 --> 00:16:06.612
Not yet.

148
00:16:10.823 --> 00:16:12.982
- Do you have more water? - Are you serious?

149
00:16:12.982 --> 00:16:15.722
You're so indecent. That's the last one.

150
00:16:15.992 --> 00:16:17.022
Are we out?

151
00:16:17.022 --> 00:16:18.463
Yes. We have to go buy some.

152
00:16:18.693 --> 00:16:19.862
I'll go then.

153
00:16:20.122 --> 00:16:22.833
Why are you going? He should go.

154
00:16:23.033 --> 00:16:25.563
I want some air. It feels stuffy.

155
00:16:27.602 --> 00:16:29.732
I'll open it since I'm going out.

156
00:16:32.073 --> 00:16:33.813
Hello. Come on in.

157
00:16:35.472 --> 00:16:36.872
Hello.

158
00:16:37.183 --> 00:16:38.913
Mr. Park sent it over for you to eat.

159
00:16:39.242 --> 00:16:40.242
What about Jung Woo?

160
00:16:40.852 --> 00:16:41.913
He's in the car.

161
00:16:41.913 --> 00:16:44.722
He should come in, so we can eat it together.

162
00:16:58.732 --> 00:17:00.972
Mr. Park, did you eat?

163
00:17:06.073 --> 00:17:07.073
Not yet.

164
00:17:07.343 --> 00:17:09.973
Come eat with us. Do you have other plans?

165
00:17:11.543 --> 00:17:12.543
No.

166
00:17:16.182 --> 00:17:18.882
You should take care of yourself too, instead of focusing on just us.

167
00:17:27.533 --> 00:17:28.632
Go wait inside.

168
00:17:29.033 --> 00:17:30.033
Where are you going?

169
00:17:30.293 --> 00:17:31.303
To buy water.

170
00:17:31.833 --> 00:17:32.932
Let's go together then.

171
00:17:33.932 --> 00:17:34.932
Sure.

172
00:17:44.513 --> 00:17:46.343
I'll get this.

173
00:17:46.343 --> 00:17:47.612
Buy everything you want.

174
00:17:48.412 --> 00:17:49.483
You'll regret it.

175
00:17:49.483 --> 00:17:50.583
Under 30 dollars.

176
00:17:50.983 --> 00:17:52.422
You're too cheap.

177
00:17:52.753 --> 00:17:55.223
I did so many things for you, and I get 30 dollars?

178
00:17:55.523 --> 00:17:57.862
You can get 20 instant noodles with 30 dollars.

179
00:17:58.162 --> 00:17:59.223
The big ones too.

180
00:18:02.432 --> 00:18:04.862
This is the spiciest instant noodles on the market.

181
00:18:04.862 --> 00:18:06.303
You can only get it at this convenience store.

182
00:18:09.973 --> 00:18:11.743
It's you who likes spicy things.

183
00:18:12.702 --> 00:18:15.343
That's true. What do you like?

184
00:18:16.142 --> 00:18:17.142
Sweet things?

185
00:18:18.743 --> 00:18:19.743
What about this?

186
00:18:20.813 --> 00:18:21.813
And a strawberry milk.

187
00:18:23.723 --> 00:18:25.652
You have a child's taste.

188
00:18:46.573 --> 00:18:48.273
Hold this. I'll carry that.

189
00:18:48.412 --> 00:18:49.442
I don't want to.

190
00:18:50.142 --> 00:18:51.483
It's heavy.

191
00:18:51.583 --> 00:18:54.313
That's why we're sharing the load.

192
00:18:54.352 --> 00:18:56.112
You never listen.

193
00:18:56.253 --> 00:18:57.682
- Give it to me. - It's okay.

194
00:19:00.652 --> 00:19:01.793
Did you get hurt?

195
00:19:05.122 --> 00:19:06.593
Why would I get hurt.

196
00:19:07.763 --> 00:19:08.763
Here.

197
00:19:09.833 --> 00:19:11.003
You can carry this.

198
00:19:17.642 --> 00:19:18.973
It's super light.

199
00:19:19.473 --> 00:19:20.712
We're already home.

200
00:19:21.412 --> 00:19:22.442
That's why I gave it to you now.

201
00:19:27.253 --> 00:19:29.452
- Watch your step. - Okay.

202
00:19:30.652 --> 00:19:31.753
This one's heavy.

203
00:19:51.543 --> 00:19:52.973
Don't cry by yourself.

204
00:19:53.813 --> 00:19:57.013
If you cry alone, that means you won't let me in your life.

205
00:19:57.783 --> 00:20:00.112
I can only love you deeper and understand you more...

206
00:20:00.952 --> 00:20:03.513
if I know exactly what's making you suffer.

207
00:20:14.093 --> 00:20:16.793
Chef On Jung Sun booked a meeting at 9am.

208
00:20:18.602 --> 00:20:21.432
He said 30 minutes would do it, so I put it in between.

209
00:20:21.573 --> 00:20:22.902
Should I cancel it?

210
00:20:23.743 --> 00:20:24.773
No.

211
00:20:33.952 --> 00:20:35.412
Why did you want to meet?

212
00:20:39.253 --> 00:20:40.283
Here.

213
00:20:41.352 --> 00:20:43.652
I won't cancel the agreement. It's a three-year contract.

214
00:20:45.223 --> 00:20:46.892
I sent it to you because I thought you'd be uncomfortable.

215
00:20:47.932 --> 00:20:50.632
I told you I wouldn't let you lose any money.

216
00:20:50.932 --> 00:20:53.033
I'm getting a lot of offers.

217
00:20:53.662 --> 00:20:56.033
If you want to be a proper agent, take care of that too.

218
00:20:57.702 --> 00:20:59.343
Okay, send them over.

219
00:21:00.202 --> 00:21:03.043
I'm going to Hong Kong on Chef Eric Song's recommendation.

220
00:21:03.412 --> 00:21:06.043
I took care of it myself, so you don't get commission.

221
00:21:10.182 --> 00:21:11.253
Hyun Soo's drama...

222
00:21:12.083 --> 00:21:13.323
will air earlier than we had schedule.

223
00:21:15.723 --> 00:21:16.892
That's great.

224
00:21:40.852 --> 00:21:42.452
- Surprise! - Surprise!

225
00:21:42.452 --> 00:21:43.882
(We congratulate Chef On with all of our hearts!)

226
00:21:44.583 --> 00:21:45.652
Hey.

227
00:21:46.483 --> 00:21:47.852
What is all this?

228
00:21:47.852 --> 00:21:49.723
We congratulate Chef On Jung Sun...

229
00:21:49.723 --> 00:21:51.662
with all of our hearts and minds!

230
00:21:51.823 --> 00:21:53.323
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

231
00:21:57.132 --> 00:21:59.263
- Gosh. - Chef On.

232
00:21:59.303 --> 00:22:01.702
- Come back safely! - Congratulations.

233
00:22:09.912 --> 00:22:12.983
I decided to accept an offer to become a head chef in Hong Kong.

234
00:22:15.313 --> 00:22:16.313
Will you come with me?

235
00:22:18.283 --> 00:22:20.523
If we're together somewhere else,

236
00:22:21.692 --> 00:22:24.392
maybe we might be able to go back to how we were.

237
00:22:27.063 --> 00:22:28.563
I said I'll drive you.

238
00:22:28.892 --> 00:22:30.233
It's okay.

239
00:22:30.402 --> 00:22:33.003
I need you to take care of Good Soup for a while.

240
00:22:33.702 --> 00:22:34.733
Okay.

241
00:22:48.583 --> 00:22:53.452
(It was the last call from him. Where can I see him now?)

242
00:22:54.793 --> 00:22:56.753
He asked me to wait.

243
00:22:57.563 --> 00:22:58.593
(I have a man I love.)

244
00:22:58.593 --> 00:23:00.122
He called me,

245
00:23:01.132 --> 00:23:03.733
but I couldn't pick up because I was with you.

246
00:23:04.702 --> 00:23:06.733
Where can I see him now?

247
00:23:11.872 --> 00:23:13.402
Are you editing episode four?

248
00:23:14.773 --> 00:23:17.412
- Yes. - In the scene where...

249
00:23:17.412 --> 00:23:19.283
Joon Ho confesses and Yeon Woo says she misses Hae Young...

250
00:23:19.942 --> 00:23:20.983
Yes?

251
00:23:21.112 --> 00:23:23.412
The collective monologue.

252
00:23:23.583 --> 00:23:26.053
Isn't it too cruel to Joon Ho?

253
00:23:28.152 --> 00:23:29.192
Do you think so?

254
00:23:29.192 --> 00:23:32.192
That's how desperate Yeon Woo's love is.

255
00:23:32.662 --> 00:23:34.533
Why do you keep on picking on the script?

256
00:23:34.593 --> 00:23:35.833
She put him to shame...

257
00:23:35.833 --> 00:23:38.263
because of her own love.

258
00:23:38.932 --> 00:23:40.672
That's what love is.

259
00:23:40.672 --> 00:23:43.172
Love is cruel to the person they're not in love with.

260
00:23:43.902 --> 00:23:47.343
You say people are hypocrites, but you're going back and forth.

261
00:23:48.642 --> 00:23:51.442
I regretted it so much, and it hurt so much. How can I forget it?

262
00:23:52.243 --> 00:23:55.053
I thought it was a good idea, but I was wrong.

263
00:23:55.783 --> 00:23:57.323
I love you, Jung Sun.

264
00:23:59.783 --> 00:24:02.323
I realized that it's a feeling you only get once in your life.

265
00:24:02.892 --> 00:24:05.662
I got to understand in the five years you were gone.

266
00:24:07.462 --> 00:24:08.662
I'll wait for you.

267
00:24:09.563 --> 00:24:10.902
Let's live together.

268
00:24:11.803 --> 00:24:12.833
Let's do that.

269
00:24:14.202 --> 00:24:16.073
I lost you while thinking about it.

270
00:24:16.073 --> 00:24:17.343
Why should I think anymore?

271
00:24:19.672 --> 00:24:20.743
Will you come with me?

272
00:24:23.912 --> 00:24:25.813
I need to step out for a moment.

273
00:24:29.313 --> 00:24:31.783
(Seoul to Incheon International Airport)

274
00:24:57.142 --> 00:24:59.442
(Seoul to Incheon International Airport)

275
00:25:13.662 --> 00:25:15.593
They say buying someone shoes will make them run away.

276
00:25:16.263 --> 00:25:18.333
I bought them so you could run away to me.

277
00:25:23.233 --> 00:25:24.402
With us,

278
00:25:24.872 --> 00:25:26.872
I was either too fast for Hyun Soo,

279
00:25:27.543 --> 00:25:29.172
or Hyun Soo was too fast for me.

280
00:25:32.912 --> 00:25:34.682
If we don't want time to beat us,

281
00:25:35.583 --> 00:25:37.483
all we can do is to just continue being in love.

282
00:25:43.053 --> 00:25:45.063
I have no idea what time he's leaving.

283
00:25:45.892 --> 00:25:47.033
I want to get to him...

284
00:25:48.132 --> 00:25:49.593
even if it's like this.
