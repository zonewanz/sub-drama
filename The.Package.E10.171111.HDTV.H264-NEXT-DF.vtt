<i>[This program is suitable
for viewers ages 15 and up.]</i>

3
00:00:14.285 --> 00:00:16.362
- Why did you do it?
- I'm sorry.

4
00:00:16.362 --> 00:00:20.020
Is that an answer?
What's the real reason?

5
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.860
I was working on an assignment,
and I wanted to stand out.

6
00:00:25.398 --> 00:00:27.871
Why? Did you want to be popular?

7
00:00:27.871 --> 00:00:29.197
Yes.

8
00:00:31.226 --> 00:00:33.803
Did you do that just to be popular?

9
00:00:33.803 --> 00:00:36.032
I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

10
00:00:36.032 --> 00:00:38.271
An apology won't solve this issue.

11
00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:42.111
This school will be inspected
by the district because of you.

12
00:00:42.111 --> 00:00:47.390
If you forgive me, I'll become
a hard-working student who only studies.

13
00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:56.447
Just tell them what you just told me.

14
00:00:56.447 --> 00:00:58.935
This is the best answer
you can give them, okay?

15
00:00:58.935 --> 00:01:00.325
Yes.

16
00:01:00.325 --> 00:01:03.533
I believe in you, Na Hyun.

17
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:05.465
You can do a good job, right?

18
00:01:07.339 --> 00:01:10.145
- What about your father?
- He'll be here soon.

19
00:01:10.145 --> 00:01:12.556
Okay, let's go inside.

20
00:01:12.556 --> 00:01:15.429
- Yes.
- Take a deep breath.

21
00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.018
Isn't your skirt too short?

22
00:01:21.839 --> 00:01:23.214
Yes.

23
00:01:29.426 --> 00:01:30.682
I'm ready.

24
00:01:38.797 --> 00:01:41.508
<i>[Disciplinary Committee Meeting]</i>

25
00:01:46.916 --> 00:01:51.911
As her homeroom teacher,
I'd like to apologize for her behavior.

26
00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:54.256
I'm not here to hear an apology.

27
00:01:54.931 --> 00:01:57.991
What were you thinking when you did that?

28
00:01:57.991 --> 00:02:01.092
I'm sorry. If you forgive me

29
00:02:01.092 --> 00:02:04.521
- I'll become a hard-working...
- I asked you for a reason.

30
00:02:05.011 --> 00:02:07.714
I noticed that your grades
aren't that great either.

31
00:02:07.714 --> 00:02:13.061
If you got good grades, I would have
thought you had your reasons, but...

32
00:02:14.556 --> 00:02:16.154
This is unbelievable.

33
00:02:17.758 --> 00:02:19.245
Why did you do that?

34
00:02:19.245 --> 00:02:22.716
First, why don't we sit down
and speak calmly?

35
00:02:22.716 --> 00:02:24.176
Because it was funny.

36
00:02:26.597 --> 00:02:28.761
What? It's funny.

37
00:02:28.761 --> 00:02:30.912
- Na Hyun.
- Look at her.

38
00:02:30.912 --> 00:02:34.038
- The whole thing is funny.
- What do you know?

39
00:02:34.038 --> 00:02:36.858
- Then what do you know, Lady?
- Hey!

40
00:02:36.858 --> 00:02:40.727
<i>Listen to her! Wait a minute!</i>

41
00:02:40.727 --> 00:02:43.464
<i>Principal, will you allow this?</i>

42
00:02:51.267 --> 00:02:53.618
<i>How can we forgive her?</i>

43
00:02:53.618 --> 00:02:55.478
<i>I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

44
00:02:55.478 --> 00:03:00.179
<i>To be honest, I just
wanted to ask a question.</i>

45
00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:03.645
<i>Because I don't know very much about it.</i>

46
00:03:10.307 --> 00:03:19.053
<i>[You don't even understand.]</i>

47
00:03:20.243 --> 00:03:23.783
It's nice to hold my daughter's hand.

48
00:03:23.783 --> 00:03:26.924
Stop swinging my arm.
Your arm's short, too.

49
00:03:26.924 --> 00:03:31.561
My legs are short too.
It's okay because I'm proportional.

50
00:03:31.561 --> 00:03:33.265
What the heck?

51
00:03:33.265 --> 00:03:35.283
When are you getting married?

52
00:03:39.382 --> 00:03:41.731
When the time comes...

53
00:03:41.731 --> 00:03:44.198
Do you like her that much?

54
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.493
I just think... she'll become
a good mother to you.

55
00:03:49.493 --> 00:03:53.925
I don't need a good mother.
I can't be a good daughter anyway.

56
00:03:55.509 --> 00:04:00.015
- But if you spend time together...
- Aren't you sorry

57
00:04:00.015 --> 00:04:01.872
that we came here without her?

58
00:04:02.537 --> 00:04:05.710
- Why would I be sorry?
- Aren't you sorry at all?

59
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.753
Not at all? Never?

60
00:04:07.753 --> 00:04:11.037
Of course not. I'm a fair man.

61
00:04:12.353 --> 00:04:14.169
Then don't marry her.

62
00:04:27.715 --> 00:04:29.814
This trip will be over in three days.

63
00:04:30.998 --> 00:04:32.751
You're right.

64
00:04:32.751 --> 00:04:35.847
What do you think
we'll be doing in three days?

65
00:04:35.847 --> 00:04:39.903
I'm sure one of us will be back at work

66
00:04:39.903 --> 00:04:42.919
and one of us will continue
working as a guide.

67
00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:44.789
Do you have plans to go back to Korea?

68
00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:50.124
Let's go inside.
The tide is rising, so it's cold.

69
00:04:50.124 --> 00:04:51.273
Let's go.

70
00:04:58.787 --> 00:05:01.016
How long will you hold my hand for?

71
00:05:01.016 --> 00:05:02.705
Are you worried the others will see?

72
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.662
Do you know how fatal
this act can be for a guide?

73
00:05:06.662 --> 00:05:09.955
Then, just until we get to the hotel.

74
00:05:10.527 --> 00:05:15.001
- Fine, just until then.
- Fine, just until then.

75
00:05:24.436 --> 00:05:27.446
We're here. Just until here.

76
00:05:27.446 --> 00:05:31.263
That's too bad.
Should we walk back to the beach?

77
00:05:31.263 --> 00:05:32.910
Forget it.

78
00:05:33.753 --> 00:05:37.129
- We made a lot of money.
- You're right.

79
00:05:39.321 --> 00:05:40.804
Look over there.

80
00:05:40.804 --> 00:05:43.628
- What?
- Don't you see them?

81
00:05:43.628 --> 00:05:45.448
It's no joke.

82
00:05:45.448 --> 00:05:49.320
I know. They had a fling, then fought,
so they're on bad terms. I know.

83
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.938
Let's go. It's cold.

84
00:05:57.547 --> 00:06:01.765
<i>How many categories fall
under the word "love"?</i>

85
00:06:02.496 --> 00:06:06.919
<i>I'm not sure. There must be many.</i>

86
00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:11.320
<i>Joy, sadness, happiness, excitement.</i>

87
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.609
Hurt, wounds, longing...

88
00:06:15.609 --> 00:06:18.042
and sorrow.

89
00:06:18.042 --> 00:06:19.636
Rage?

90
00:06:20.347 --> 00:06:22.734
- That too.
- Tears.

91
00:06:22.734 --> 00:06:25.554
- That would count too.
- Hedonism.

92
00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.284
Doesn't that count?

93
00:06:29.955 --> 00:06:33.044
Is that... what you wanted to talk about?

94
00:06:33.044 --> 00:06:36.434
No, it's just a question.

95
00:06:37.092 --> 00:06:41.866
Don't you think...
that question is wrong overall?

96
00:06:43.378 --> 00:06:46.208
What's wrong with asking a question.

97
00:06:47.534 --> 00:06:49.537
I guess there's nothing wrong.

98
00:06:50.633 --> 00:06:53.124
What did your dad say after he saw it?

99
00:06:53.124 --> 00:06:56.407
My dad usually doesn't tell me
I did anything wrong.

100
00:06:56.407 --> 00:06:59.018
- The timing was good too.
- The timing?

101
00:06:59.018 --> 00:07:00.592
When did he see it?

102
00:07:04.236 --> 00:07:08.758
You scared me! Don't stare at me
like that! You look like a ghost!

103
00:07:08.758 --> 00:07:09.773
I'm sorry.

104
00:07:09.773 --> 00:07:13.061
What is this?
You scared the crap out of me.

105
00:07:15.379 --> 00:07:17.864
Na Hyun, I have something to tell you.

106
00:07:17.864 --> 00:07:20.032
Tell me tomorrow.

107
00:07:22.604 --> 00:07:24.761
I'm dating someone.

108
00:07:27.674 --> 00:07:30.107
What do you think about having a mother?

109
00:07:38.825 --> 00:07:42.210
- I have something to tell you too.
- Sure, go ahead.

110
00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.407
I handed in an assignment recently

111
00:07:45.407 --> 00:07:47.816
and mine was voted first place.

112
00:07:47.816 --> 00:07:50.626
Wow, that's my daughter.

113
00:07:50.626 --> 00:07:54.994
So I uploaded it onto the internet,
but the school wants to talk to you.

114
00:07:54.994 --> 00:07:57.450
Why? Are you getting an award?

115
00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:01.457
Is it the "Best Dad Award"?
Wait a minute.

116
00:08:01.457 --> 00:08:04.955
Is there any prize money?
What should we do with it?

117
00:08:04.955 --> 00:08:09.023
- Should we buy meat?
<i>- My dad is a bit childish.</i>

118
00:08:12.241 --> 00:08:13.943
<i>I wasn't worried, though.</i>

119
00:08:13.943 --> 00:08:18.451
<i>No matter what I do,
my dad never resents me.</i>

120
00:08:21.727 --> 00:08:23.931
<i>These are the youth of our country.</i>

121
00:08:24.693 --> 00:08:27.241
<i>How do they seem in your eyes?</i>

122
00:08:27.941 --> 00:08:31.035
<i>A famous person once said this.</i>

123
00:08:31.035 --> 00:08:34.877
<i>Just like how drunk people think
they're walking straight</i>

124
00:08:34.877 --> 00:08:38.687
<i>kids often think they're smart.</i>

125
00:08:45.257 --> 00:08:48.814
<i>Is it possible that no kid
is as smart as they think?</i>

126
00:08:48.814 --> 00:08:50.989
Where did you find that suit?

127
00:08:50.989 --> 00:08:53.055
<i>Are they unable to walk straight?</i>

128
00:08:53.055 --> 00:08:57.450
<i>Is that why adults
must reenact everything?</i>

129
00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:01.822
We've received video footage
from a youth.

130
00:09:26.548 --> 00:09:27.683
It's 5,000 won.

131
00:09:27.683 --> 00:09:29.196
That's right.

132
00:09:29.196 --> 00:09:33.998
Many people think that youth
are prohibited from buying condoms.

133
00:09:33.998 --> 00:09:39.223
<i>The truth is, it's an average item
that anyone can buy.</i>

134
00:09:40.383 --> 00:09:44.026
But my question is,
does it apply to all condoms?

135
00:09:51.077 --> 00:09:53.769
- Are you a student?
- Yes.

136
00:09:53.769 --> 00:09:55.970
This can't be bought
by underaged individuals.

137
00:09:56.797 --> 00:10:01.253
They're the same, but the general-type
is allowed, yet the special-type is not.

138
00:10:01.253 --> 00:10:03.058
What are their criteria?

139
00:10:03.058 --> 00:10:04.495
<i>After looking into it</i>

140
00:10:04.495 --> 00:10:09.468
we worked hard to find
the student from the footage.

141
00:10:09.468 --> 00:10:13.461
It was absurd. Aren't they all the same?

142
00:10:13.461 --> 00:10:17.283
But, you'll blur out my face, right?

143
00:10:18.795 --> 00:10:20.989
What on earth is going on?

144
00:10:20.989 --> 00:10:24.888
We asked the authorities
for an interview.

145
00:10:24.888 --> 00:10:30.509
<i>Through the "Prohibited and Harmful
Articles for Youth" notification of 2011</i>

146
00:10:30.509 --> 00:10:34.478
<i>special-type condoms are
prohibited for underaged youth.</i>

147
00:10:34.478 --> 00:10:35.980
<i>If anyone violates this</i>

148
00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.755
<i>it can lead to a year in jail
or a five million won fine.</i>

149
00:10:39.755 --> 00:10:43.382
Why did the authorities
make this decision?

150
00:10:43.382 --> 00:10:46.206
<i>You're an adult, so you must know.</i>

151
00:10:46.206 --> 00:10:50.502
<i>If a youth buys a special-type condom,
they could feel pleasure.</i>

152
00:10:50.502 --> 00:10:53.374
<i>Are you saying youth
are not allowed feel pleasure?</i>

153
00:10:53.374 --> 00:10:55.181
<i>Of course not.</i>

154
00:10:55.181 --> 00:10:57.860
<i>Students should focus on their studies.</i>

155
00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:03.617
<i>We believe it's right to ban youth from
pleasure for the good of their futures.</i>

156
00:11:03.617 --> 00:11:08.736
Our PD had no words for
what the authorities had to say.

157
00:11:08.736 --> 00:11:13.499
It's because we're also adults
who need to protect the youth.

158
00:11:13.499 --> 00:11:15.403
But let's listen.

159
00:11:16.047 --> 00:11:22.287
Isn't this funny? I feel like they think
we're completely dirty kids.

160
00:11:22.287 --> 00:11:27.071
It's possible that she filmed the footage
without knowing much about its meaning.

161
00:11:27.071 --> 00:11:32.668
However, we walked away
from this with one question.

162
00:11:33.835 --> 00:11:34.867
Regulation.

163
00:11:34.867 --> 00:11:39.382
Is regulation the easiest way
to control the world?

164
00:11:39.382 --> 00:11:41.465
Is it the best method?

165
00:11:43.637 --> 00:11:47.591
That student's footage
will end as a revolt.

166
00:12:48.816 --> 00:12:50.273
Na Hyun.

167
00:12:51.412 --> 00:12:53.773
What is this?

168
00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:57.697
It's a fictional documentary film.

169
00:12:59.672 --> 00:13:01.374
You edited it well.

170
00:13:06.066 --> 00:13:08.503
But are you...

171
00:13:10.154 --> 00:13:13.875
- doing it with your boyfriend...
<i>- I don't know why he's like that.</i>

172
00:13:13.875 --> 00:13:17.375
"Is it because you have a boyfriend?
Is that what you're doing with him?"

173
00:13:17.375 --> 00:13:20.550
- That's what the school asked too.
- Yes.

174
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:22.546
I don't even have a boyfriend.

175
00:13:22.546 --> 00:13:26.874
There were a few guys I liked,
but I hated that they were like my dad.

176
00:13:26.874 --> 00:13:29.503
- In what way?
- They're totally immature.

177
00:13:29.503 --> 00:13:33.349
Really? How did your father react?

178
00:13:36.012 --> 00:13:40.255
He was serious about it,
and then asked to go on a vacation.

179
00:13:40.255 --> 00:13:42.694
A vacation? Where?

180
00:13:42.694 --> 00:13:45.590
- France.
- You must be excited.

181
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:50.714
Not really. He'll talk about
school and marriage if we go.

182
00:13:50.714 --> 00:13:53.418
- It's annoying.
- But I'm still jealous.

183
00:13:53.418 --> 00:13:54.880
It's France.

184
00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.385
Are you really against the marriage?

185
00:14:12.385 --> 00:14:13.798
Yeah.

186
00:14:15.291 --> 00:14:19.050
- Why?
- Just because.

187
00:14:19.648 --> 00:14:21.826
You must have a reason.

188
00:14:24.287 --> 00:14:25.600
I'm going to sleep.

189
00:14:54.223 --> 00:14:57.845
There are three well-known
vacations in France.

190
00:14:57.845 --> 00:15:02.681
Their summer vacation,
their Christmas vacation

191
00:15:02.681 --> 00:15:05.436
and their ski vacation in February.

192
00:15:05.436 --> 00:15:08.582
Their summer vacations last for a month.

193
00:15:08.582 --> 00:15:12.729
And most people go off on vacations
just like us during our holidays.

194
00:15:12.729 --> 00:15:15.843
They call them "les grand vacances."

195
00:15:15.843 --> 00:15:18.358
Their vacation is a month long?

196
00:15:18.358 --> 00:15:21.317
- Yes, aren't you jealous.
- Yes, I'm jealous.

197
00:15:21.317 --> 00:15:24.300
Who keeps the economy
alive during that month?

198
00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.950
The public officials'
working hours are reduced

199
00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:31.050
and many shops close, but no one
worries about the economy.

200
00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:34.838
They know that they have to rest
enjoyably to work enjoyably.

201
00:15:34.838 --> 00:15:39.401
What do they do for a month?
Doesn't it get boring?

202
00:15:39.401 --> 00:15:43.037
They do nothing but rest,
or they go on a vacation.

203
00:15:43.037 --> 00:15:45.090
They're different from us.

204
00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:49.239
Koreans don't know
how to do much except work.

205
00:15:49.239 --> 00:15:51.161
Where do they usually go for vacation?

206
00:15:51.161 --> 00:15:53.778
Beaches are the best
destinations for vacation.

207
00:15:53.778 --> 00:15:57.533
There are three vacation spots
that French workers love.

208
00:15:57.533 --> 00:16:02.205
Nice, near the the Mediterranean.
Saint-Tropez, of Fauvism painters.

209
00:16:02.205 --> 00:16:06.648
And the beach out of a movie, Deauville.

210
00:16:07.117 --> 00:16:10.101
Wow, it's just like Haeundae.

211
00:16:10.748 --> 00:16:15.021
This was where
"A Man and a Woman" was filmed.

212
00:16:15.021 --> 00:16:20.154
That's it for me.
After enjoying your free time

213
00:16:20.154 --> 00:16:22.758
please meet at the bus by 5 p.m.

214
00:16:22.758 --> 00:16:25.508
You should stay and play with us too.

215
00:16:25.508 --> 00:16:27.827
Should I? What should we do?

216
00:16:27.827 --> 00:16:30.811
Good question.
What are we supposed to do?

217
00:16:30.811 --> 00:16:32.490
That's what I'm saying.

218
00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:35.417
We all need to practice
enjoying free time.

219
00:16:35.417 --> 00:16:40.625
Take a look around the markets,
and take a walk holding hands.

220
00:16:41.176 --> 00:16:43.329
Then, I'll see you tomorrow.

221
00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:47.907
I'm going to take a walk through
the streets. I'll see you later.

222
00:16:47.907 --> 00:16:49.394
Yes.

223
00:16:50.966 --> 00:16:53.695
- Catch me!
- Have fun.

224
00:16:53.695 --> 00:16:55.322
You didn't put on sunscreen, did you?

225
00:16:55.322 --> 00:16:57.749
It stings when it gets in my eyes.

226
00:16:57.749 --> 00:16:59.861
Come here. You'll get freckles.

227
00:17:00.945 --> 00:17:03.811
You have nice skin. I'm jealous.

228
00:17:06.546 --> 00:17:09.020
- Pat it down.
- Like this?

229
00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.607
Lightly, like this.

230
00:17:11.607 --> 00:17:13.042
Thank you.

231
00:17:14.628 --> 00:17:16.419
Gosh, you didn't put any
on either, did you?

232
00:17:16.419 --> 00:17:19.369
I'm too old for that.

233
00:17:19.369 --> 00:17:21.017
Close your eyes.

234
00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:23.745
Lightly.

235
00:17:27.906 --> 00:17:29.273
Pat it down.

236
00:17:31.818 --> 00:17:34.324
I'll see you later. Bye.

237
00:17:47.299 --> 00:17:49.226
I told you not to walk near me.

238
00:17:49.226 --> 00:17:51.419
You're open for a private tour, right?

239
00:17:51.419 --> 00:17:54.515
- No.
- It was on the schedule.

240
00:17:55.423 --> 00:17:57.324
Was it?

241
00:17:57.324 --> 00:18:00.054
Yes, you're right, Customer.

242
00:18:00.054 --> 00:18:02.767
It's 50 euros, right? Count me in.

243
00:18:02.767 --> 00:18:05.830
That's okay. You don't have to
pay me to go on a date with you.

244
00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:07.974
It's so other people won't find out.

245
00:18:07.974 --> 00:18:11.978
You're funny. Then you shouldn't
ask me out in the first place.

246
00:18:11.978 --> 00:18:15.043
- Put your wallet away.
- Big Sis!

247
00:18:19.782 --> 00:18:21.607
Yes, where are you going?

248
00:18:21.607 --> 00:18:25.861
50 euros, please. San Ma Ru
asked for a private tour.

249
00:18:25.861 --> 00:18:28.572
If you pay an extra 20 euros,
I can give you a bike tour too.

250
00:18:28.572 --> 00:18:33.524
You can ride a bike through
Deauville. It's really romantic and nice.

251
00:18:34.082 --> 00:18:36.716
I'll do that. 70 euros.

252
00:18:36.716 --> 00:18:38.205
Us too.

253
00:18:38.205 --> 00:18:40.315
Why?

254
00:18:40.315 --> 00:18:43.812
Can we get a discount if we both do it?

255
00:18:43.812 --> 00:18:44.991
What?

256
00:18:44.991 --> 00:18:48.136
We saw you in front of
the hotel yesterday.

257
00:18:48.608 --> 00:18:52.879
I went all over the place,
so I don't remember.

258
00:18:53.424 --> 00:18:56.234
You two were together
late at night yesterday.

259
00:19:01.032 --> 00:19:05.496
We coincidentally ran into
each other. It wasn't that late.

260
00:19:05.496 --> 00:19:07.459
Wasn't it around dinner time?

261
00:19:07.459 --> 00:19:11.353
Yes, the sun was just about to set.

262
00:19:11.353 --> 00:19:13.475
About that...

263
00:19:17.522 --> 00:19:21.879
Can I ask you where you bought
the dress you were wearing?

264
00:19:21.879 --> 00:19:24.675
- My dress?
- Yes, your dress.

265
00:19:24.675 --> 00:19:26.675
About that...

266
00:19:26.675 --> 00:19:29.699
I bought it in Paris,
but it was cheap.

267
00:19:29.699 --> 00:19:31.561
It's not designer.

268
00:19:31.561 --> 00:19:32.778
Where in Paris?

269
00:19:32.778 --> 00:19:37.439
It's a shop in an alleyway. I'll show you
the way tomorrow when we get to Paris.

270
00:19:37.439 --> 00:19:40.747
Thank you. Enjoy your day.

271
00:19:40.747 --> 00:19:42.850
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

272
00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:49.531
Do you think "Thank you"
was an appropriate response?

273
00:19:49.531 --> 00:19:51.380
Was it inappropriate?

274
00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:54.734
You acknowledged what she said.

275
00:19:54.734 --> 00:19:58.484
I'm... scared of that woman.

276
00:19:58.484 --> 00:19:59.856
Me too.

277
00:19:59.856 --> 00:20:02.501
We could shop after a bike ride.

278
00:20:02.501 --> 00:20:04.877
- Stop it.
- Is it because it's expensive?

279
00:20:04.877 --> 00:20:06.895
Why would we butt into their date?

280
00:20:06.895 --> 00:20:10.878
It's not a date. He paid her
the private tour fee and everything.

281
00:20:10.878 --> 00:20:13.984
He did. In a totally awkward way.

282
00:20:24.241 --> 00:20:25.641
How was that? Killer, right?

283
00:20:25.641 --> 00:20:27.494
Cut. Again.

284
00:20:28.201 --> 00:20:29.717
<i>Why? I liked my acting.</i>

285
00:20:29.717 --> 00:20:31.417
You said "Killer."

286
00:20:31.417 --> 00:20:33.118
<i>Let's lie down.</i>

287
00:20:34.871 --> 00:20:37.292
- Ready?
- Let's stop.

288
00:20:37.292 --> 00:20:38.756
Action!

289
00:20:49.483 --> 00:20:51.984
<i>Na Hyun!</i>

290
00:20:56.773 --> 00:20:58.705
Geez, the breeze feels nice.

291
00:20:59.446 --> 00:21:01.494
This is the wind of France.

292
00:21:01.494 --> 00:21:03.504
Don't do any ad-libs.

293
00:21:04.141 --> 00:21:06.513
<i>I want this wind
to take me back to Korea.</i>

294
00:21:08.626 --> 00:21:12.616
<i>I like France,
but I don't want to go with Dad.</i>

295
00:21:13.269 --> 00:21:17.109
It seems like he adores you very much.

296
00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:20.763
That's why. He always
worries about what I think.

297
00:21:20.763 --> 00:21:23.607
It's not his fault that Mom passed away

298
00:21:23.607 --> 00:21:26.639
and getting remarried
isn't his fault either.

299
00:21:26.639 --> 00:21:29.453
But from his standpoint,
he must feel sorry.

300
00:21:30.484 --> 00:21:33.013
That's why I don't want him
to get married.

301
00:21:33.013 --> 00:21:36.562
Why? Are you afraid
she'll steal him away?

302
00:21:37.049 --> 00:21:42.205
No, he has no right to love someone.

303
00:21:42.205 --> 00:21:44.948
This is what he said
when my mom passed away.

304
00:21:46.885 --> 00:21:49.406
Dad, why are you crying?

305
00:21:54.609 --> 00:21:56.907
Because I love you too much.

306
00:21:56.907 --> 00:21:59.551
Do you cry when you love
someone too much?

307
00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:06.686
If you love someone,
you end up feeling sorry in many ways.

308
00:22:08.487 --> 00:22:13.141
But he said he doesn't feel sorry
for the woman who will become my mother.

309
00:22:13.141 --> 00:22:15.420
He probably feels sorry to her

310
00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:19.496
but he can't say it because
he feels more sorry toward you.

311
00:22:19.496 --> 00:22:21.792
- Do you think so?
- Of course.

312
00:22:21.792 --> 00:22:26.231
We learned it in class.
Our country follows civil law

313
00:22:26.231 --> 00:22:28.446
where concurrent offenses occur

314
00:22:28.446 --> 00:22:30.716
which is why we only consider
the heaviest crimes.

315
00:22:30.716 --> 00:22:35.813
Don't you think your dad is only
expressing his heaviest emotion?

316
00:22:35.813 --> 00:22:37.201
Pardon?

317
00:22:38.022 --> 00:22:39.904
Let's study some more, Na Hyun.

318
00:22:40.722 --> 00:22:43.708
You said you didn't want to
study as a child either.

319
00:22:43.708 --> 00:22:46.744
But you still have to study
to have freedom.

320
00:22:46.744 --> 00:22:48.956
Korean, English,
and Math aren't all of it.

321
00:22:48.956 --> 00:22:50.686
Then?

322
00:22:50.686 --> 00:22:52.938
Apply for after-school classes.

323
00:22:52.938 --> 00:22:54.878
You're falling behind
in memorization subjects.

324
00:22:54.878 --> 00:22:57.155
They're all memorization classes.

325
00:22:57.155 --> 00:22:59.184
Korean, English, and Math
are all memorization.

326
00:22:59.184 --> 00:23:02.388
Exactly. You have
a hard time with all of them.

327
00:23:03.884 --> 00:23:05.292
I'm sleepy.

328
00:23:05.292 --> 00:23:08.712
You're always sleepy
when we talk about school.

329
00:23:09.262 --> 00:23:11.483
I'm going to sleep.

330
00:23:15.888 --> 00:23:18.944
I won't back down today.
I need to say what's on my mind.

331
00:23:18.944 --> 00:23:22.173
- After my nap.
- Fine.

332
00:23:41.521 --> 00:23:45.350
What are you looking at?
This is just another flea market.

333
00:23:50.355 --> 00:23:54.463
Honey, what's wrong?
Are you dizzy? Are you tired?

334
00:23:55.282 --> 00:23:57.500
Don't get up. Rest for little longer.

335
00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:00.112
- I'm okay.
- You're not okay.

336
00:24:00.112 --> 00:24:04.756
I'll be better if I eat and rest.
I just got... a little dizzy.

337
00:24:04.756 --> 00:24:07.221
That's because
you're not eating properly.

338
00:24:07.221 --> 00:24:09.475
Let's hurry back and rest.

339
00:24:12.282 --> 00:24:15.437
Honey, let's go...

340
00:24:16.742 --> 00:24:18.330
Let's go together.

341
00:24:24.384 --> 00:24:25.888
What do you want to do?

342
00:24:25.888 --> 00:24:29.313
If we make a purchase
over 1.8 million won

343
00:24:29.313 --> 00:24:31.811
there's an extra fee
when we go through customs.

344
00:24:31.811 --> 00:24:34.480
We need to ask him to give us
a receipt for under 1.8 million won.

345
00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:37.025
- Will they do that?
- Probably.

346
00:24:37.025 --> 00:24:40.358
- It's my English that's the problem.
- Can you do it?

347
00:24:40.358 --> 00:24:43.856
I can do it. I just need
to be confident and say

348
00:24:43.856 --> 00:24:47.071
"I know this bag is 2,000 euros."

349
00:24:47.071 --> 00:24:50.407
"But, can you give me..."

350
00:24:50.407 --> 00:24:54.520
"a receipt for 1,300..."

351
00:24:55.225 --> 00:24:56.606
That's not it.

352
00:24:57.307 --> 00:25:02.198
No, it is. "1,300 please."
I just need to say that.

353
00:25:02.198 --> 00:25:04.407
Let's just pay the tax. I'll pay it.

354
00:25:04.407 --> 00:25:05.798
Wait a minute.

355
00:25:06.706 --> 00:25:11.159
300,000... is possible.

356
00:25:13.417 --> 00:25:15.480
- Pay the tax?
- Yes.

357
00:25:16.446 --> 00:25:18.932
1,300...

358
00:26:35.616 --> 00:26:38.242
- That's pretty.
- I'll take a picture for you.

359
00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.963
One, two, three.

360
00:26:57.011 --> 00:26:59.955
One more. One, two, three.

361
00:27:13.917 --> 00:27:15.511
Na Hyun!

362
00:27:19.159 --> 00:27:20.610
Jung Na Hyun!

363
00:27:27.647 --> 00:27:29.131
Na Hyun!

364
00:27:38.676 --> 00:27:40.946
<i>After you enjoy your free time</i>

365
00:27:40.946 --> 00:27:43.831
meet at the bus by 5 p.m.

366
00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:56.050
<i>The number is unavailable...</i>

367
00:27:59.281 --> 00:28:00.808
Jung Na Hyun!

368
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:17.357
Did you have a good time?

369
00:28:40.262 --> 00:28:42.590
Excuse me.

370
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:45.253
- Didn't Na Hyun come?
- No.

371
00:28:45.253 --> 00:28:46.618
Weren't you together?

372
00:28:46.618 --> 00:28:50.782
We were at the beach,
but she disappeared.

373
00:28:50.782 --> 00:28:52.859
She wouldn't have gone
anywhere by herself.

374
00:28:52.859 --> 00:28:56.654
This is a safe area,
so I'm sure nothing happened.

375
00:28:57.225 --> 00:29:00.528
It's not 5 p.m. yet,
so let's wait a little bit longer.

376
00:29:11.519 --> 00:29:13.311
<i>Answer your phone.</i>

377
00:29:14.871 --> 00:29:16.198
<i>Where are you?</i>

378
00:29:18.765 --> 00:29:22.552
I called the police, but they
don't have any foreigners there.

379
00:29:22.552 --> 00:29:26.226
- Did you call?
- She won't answer.

380
00:29:26.226 --> 00:29:27.725
She won't respond to my texts either.

381
00:29:27.725 --> 00:29:30.475
Do you have a tracking app on your phone?

382
00:29:31.023 --> 00:29:33.436
We got rid of it because
it was an invasion of her privacy.

383
00:29:34.887 --> 00:29:37.784
Wait here. I'll be right back.

384
00:29:45.775 --> 00:29:51.348
We'll leave soon, but one person hasn't
come back yet, so please wait here.

385
00:29:55.839 --> 00:29:58.820
She could have gotten lost,
so I'll take a look around...

386
00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:01.166
Then I'll check the beach one more time.

387
00:30:01.166 --> 00:30:04.023
If we miss each other,
it could become more difficult.

388
00:30:04.023 --> 00:30:07.761
You don't know the way,
so I think you should wait here.

389
00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:12.793
- What's the matter?
- It's nothing. Please wait inside.

390
00:30:12.793 --> 00:30:15.281
- Your partner hasn't come yet, right?
- Yes.

391
00:30:15.281 --> 00:30:18.115
I saw you calling her.
She didn't contact you?

392
00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:25.475
Then let's look for her together.
I'll look for her too.

393
00:30:25.475 --> 00:30:29.670
No, if we miss each other, it'll get
harder. And you don't know the way.

394
00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:31.434
Numbers are important for manhunts.

395
00:30:31.434 --> 00:30:34.600
I was on the search team
in the special forces.

396
00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:36.513
Is something the matter?

397
00:30:37.895 --> 00:30:42.254
You can go this way to the beach.
She could be waiting for you there.

398
00:30:42.254 --> 00:30:46.109
And you two can go this way
and take a lap around.

399
00:30:46.109 --> 00:30:49.689
So So and I will split up here
and search the alleyways.

400
00:30:49.689 --> 00:30:51.914
- Does that sound good?
- Yes.

401
00:30:51.914 --> 00:30:55.543
She could have gone into the wrong hotel
and fallen asleep while waiting.

402
00:30:55.543 --> 00:30:59.255
Check the hotel lobbies,
and call So So if you find her.

403
00:30:59.255 --> 00:31:01.167
Is something the matter?

404
00:31:03.868 --> 00:31:06.298
If we look for her, when will we eat?

405
00:31:06.298 --> 00:31:08.975
We should find her before we eat...

406
00:31:08.975 --> 00:31:12.705
A group should follow
the rules! It's time to eat!

407
00:31:12.705 --> 00:31:14.509
But someone disappeared.

408
00:31:14.509 --> 00:31:16.635
Don't be like that.
You're so cold-hearted.

409
00:31:16.635 --> 00:31:21.696
I'm not being cold-hearted!
We need to eat and rest!

410
00:31:21.696 --> 00:31:24.378
Finding her is
more important than food, sir.

411
00:31:25.042 --> 00:31:29.434
Then, he can wait here
while the rest of us eat!

412
00:31:29.434 --> 00:31:31.475
You're too much.

413
00:31:31.475 --> 00:31:33.994
- Don't be like that...
- Sir.

414
00:31:33.994 --> 00:31:38.821
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
I'll find you at the restaurant.

415
00:31:38.821 --> 00:31:40.138
I'll call you.

416
00:31:43.898 --> 00:31:45.779
Then, let's go to the restaurant.

417
00:31:45.779 --> 00:31:48.628
We'll take a lap around
as originally planned.

418
00:31:48.628 --> 00:31:49.885
Let's go.

419
00:31:51.244 --> 00:31:52.673
I'll look for her too.

420
00:31:54.529 --> 00:31:56.240
That guy.

421
00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:00.936
They're all doing whatever they want.
How can they be so selfish?

422
00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.905
- Get some rest.
- I'll look around here.

423
00:32:07.196 --> 00:32:08.600
Where are you going?

424
00:32:09.319 --> 00:32:11.907
Get some rest! You said you're dizzy!

425
00:32:14.244 --> 00:32:15.503
Father.

426
00:32:16.717 --> 00:32:20.186
Moving as a group
is important in group tours.

427
00:32:20.186 --> 00:32:24.149
But when an accident occurs,
the group needs to protect the member.

428
00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:26.826
That's the biggest advantage
to package tours.

429
00:32:26.826 --> 00:32:30.080
Get some rest. This might take a while.

430
00:32:45.104 --> 00:32:48.336
<font color="#80ffff">[DF Ver] E10 The Package</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

431
00:33:02.215 --> 00:33:04.676
- Did you find her?
- No.

432
00:33:06.005 --> 00:33:07.551
Na Hyun!

433
00:33:10.097 --> 00:33:12.035
Jung Na Hyun!

434
00:33:13.898 --> 00:33:15.372
Na Hyun!

435
00:33:17.125 --> 00:33:18.898
Jung Na Hyun!

436
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:26.013
All done. The end.

437
00:33:32.766 --> 00:33:36.667
<i>[Dad - 51 missed calls]</i>

438
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.532
I'm in trouble.

439
00:33:45.542 --> 00:33:47.128
I'm sorry.

440
00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:51.253
Am I in second place?

441
00:33:53.448 --> 00:33:55.186
That's good.

442
00:33:59.946 --> 00:34:01.384
Yes, Father.

443
00:34:01.984 --> 00:34:03.581
You found her?

444
00:34:07.409 --> 00:34:10.161
<i>The missing party is on the bus.
Please meet back at the bus.</i>

445
00:34:10.161 --> 00:34:12.748
- They found her.
- Good, let's go back.

446
00:34:15.864 --> 00:34:17.413
Na Hyun!

447
00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:20.540
Jung Na Hyun!

448
00:34:26.469 --> 00:34:27.746
Hello?

449
00:34:28.531 --> 00:34:29.877
Yes.

450
00:34:58.205 --> 00:35:02.339
You must have been worried.
She was in the hotel lobby.

451
00:35:02.339 --> 00:35:04.223
She was just around the corner.

452
00:35:20.712 --> 00:35:22.054
Dad!

453
00:35:23.947 --> 00:35:25.947
She called him "Dad."

454
00:35:25.947 --> 00:35:28.324
- Dad?
- Dad?

455
00:35:28.949 --> 00:35:30.750
He's her dad?

456
00:35:33.136 --> 00:35:35.056
I'm sorry.

457
00:35:35.056 --> 00:35:36.665
Not to me.

458
00:35:39.297 --> 00:35:42.893
- Apologize to the group.
- I already did.

459
00:35:49.101 --> 00:35:50.942
I'm sorry for being late.

460
00:36:03.031 --> 00:36:04.487
I'm sorry.

461
00:36:08.859 --> 00:36:10.527
I'm sorry.

462
00:36:20.467 --> 00:36:22.556
Thank you for your hard work.

463
00:36:22.556 --> 00:36:26.585
And you two look beautiful
as father and daughter.

464
00:36:26.585 --> 00:36:28.335
You said they were having an affair.

465
00:36:28.335 --> 00:36:31.223
This is a common occurrence
in group tours.

466
00:36:31.223 --> 00:36:35.210
So please be understanding
and forgive each other.

467
00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:37.721
It'll take 30 minutes
to get to the restaurant

468
00:36:37.721 --> 00:36:41.985
but I prepared a special menu
for today. You must be curious.

469
00:36:44.685 --> 00:36:47.297
Please get some rest
on our bus ride there.

470
00:36:52.851 --> 00:36:54.226
Jung Yeon Sung?

471
00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:57.951
Thank you.

00:37:11.275 --> 00:37:15.737
Wow, I love that you add
a lot of seasoning in your food.

473
00:37:15.737 --> 00:37:18.100
My groom likes it that way.

474
00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:20.087
You're not even married yet.

475
00:37:20.087 --> 00:37:26.072
These two have called each other "Bride,"
"Groom," and "Honey" since high school.

476
00:37:26.072 --> 00:37:28.424
I don't like either of you.

477
00:37:28.424 --> 00:37:30.306
Mother...

478
00:37:30.306 --> 00:37:33.328
What's wrong with you?
Just call me "Mom."

479
00:37:33.328 --> 00:37:36.685
- No need for that.
- Mom.

480
00:37:36.685 --> 00:37:38.985
So So is doing just fine.

481
00:37:43.261 --> 00:37:47.371
It's strange that you're not asking
questions since he came back from France.

482
00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:51.235
I don't care about that wench
who left with her own two feet.

483
00:37:52.531 --> 00:37:55.127
I'm not that curious either.

484
00:37:55.855 --> 00:37:58.302
Is she eating properly?

485
00:37:58.868 --> 00:38:01.469
- He said she's eating well.
- Bread.

486
00:38:01.469 --> 00:38:03.955
He said she's eating a lot of bread.

487
00:38:03.955 --> 00:38:06.668
- Didn't she lose weight?
- He said she gained weight.

488
00:38:06.668 --> 00:38:08.922
She's not the type to gain weight.

489
00:38:09.547 --> 00:38:11.565
Is it because she's having a hard time?

490
00:38:11.565 --> 00:38:13.786
He said she gained just enough weight.

491
00:38:16.226 --> 00:38:18.380
What is she up to over there?

492
00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:21.210
He said she's busy getting her PhD.

493
00:38:22.996 --> 00:38:25.310
It's not like she has money.
How can she afford that?

494
00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:30.020
He said she's working as a guide,
and making a lot because she's their ace.

495
00:38:31.493 --> 00:38:33.493
Is she even coming back?

496
00:38:33.493 --> 00:38:35.964
As soon as she gets her PhD.

497
00:38:38.567 --> 00:38:40.552
Did you forget Korean
after going to France?

498
00:38:40.552 --> 00:38:41.955
Why aren't you saying anything?

499
00:38:43.703 --> 00:38:46.534
- Rice.
- Hey.

500
00:38:46.534 --> 00:38:49.176
Do women live to get you rice?
Get it yourself!

501
00:38:53.578 --> 00:38:56.581
He said she'll be back for our wedding.

502
00:38:59.397 --> 00:39:00.862
Big Sis is still cool.

503
00:39:01.587 --> 00:39:03.467
She hasn't changed one bit.

504
00:39:03.467 --> 00:39:05.366
He said she's like Joan of Arc.

505
00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:09.453
Does she walk around
with armor and a sword?

506
00:39:09.453 --> 00:39:11.752
- Yes.
- Yes?

507
00:39:12.781 --> 00:39:14.668
Geez, you woman.

508
00:39:14.668 --> 00:39:19.877
If you found her, you should have dragged
her here. Why are you here by yourself?

509
00:39:19.877 --> 00:39:22.964
Can you eat after leaving
your big sister there?

510
00:39:22.964 --> 00:39:27.893
That child went all the way there,
and went through all that trouble...

511
00:39:28.493 --> 00:39:32.304
All by herself, that young thing...

512
00:39:33.815 --> 00:39:35.987
She doesn't even know how to make rice...

513
00:39:35.987 --> 00:39:38.290
I said she's eating bread!

514
00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:42.331
Not rice, but bread!
I told you she's not starving!

515
00:39:42.331 --> 00:39:45.505
She's going to come back on her own!
Why don't you trust her?

516
00:39:45.505 --> 00:39:47.964
Why are you yelling at your mother?

517
00:39:56.701 --> 00:39:58.065
I shouldn't have gone.

518
00:39:58.065 --> 00:40:01.661
- Shut up, you punk!
- I just miss her!

519
00:40:18.362 --> 00:40:20.543
What are you doing? Sit down.

520
00:40:20.543 --> 00:40:24.761
But first, let's give Big Sis Guide
a round of applause.

521
00:40:24.761 --> 00:40:26.123
Applause!

522
00:40:27.447 --> 00:40:28.942
Please sit down.

523
00:40:53.665 --> 00:40:57.141
By the way, shouldn't we
order soju for our soup?

524
00:40:57.141 --> 00:40:59.214
- Gosh, stop it.
- Alcohol.

525
00:40:59.214 --> 00:41:01.000
We need to.

526
00:41:01.685 --> 00:41:03.092
Order a soju.

527
00:41:03.092 --> 00:41:06.375
- That's okay. That's okay.
- Order it already.

528
00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:25.799
<i>[Yeon Sung]</i>

529
00:41:29.226 --> 00:41:30.440
What are you doing?

530
00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:41.110
<i>The number is unavailable...</i>

531
00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:53.025
Because we spent the whole day
on the beach under the sun

532
00:41:53.025 --> 00:41:55.362
the travel agency is giving us a gift.

533
00:41:55.362 --> 00:41:59.201
Really? They're not
charging us for it, are they?

534
00:41:59.201 --> 00:42:01.844
Pardon? No, it's a gift. It's free.

535
00:42:01.844 --> 00:42:05.752
Wow, your boss is a decent person.

536
00:42:05.752 --> 00:42:07.478
Tell him to come here.

537
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:12.433
Why are you doing that here?

538
00:42:13.114 --> 00:42:15.335
But, is there a proper side to use?

539
00:42:15.335 --> 00:42:17.054
Do it when we get to our room.

540
00:42:17.054 --> 00:42:20.946
No way, we should use good products
right away. Saving it is a waste.

541
00:42:22.413 --> 00:42:24.730
You're too much.

542
00:42:26.138 --> 00:42:28.205
- Is it good?
- Yes.

543
00:42:28.205 --> 00:42:31.210
- You have to smooth it out.
- Is it funny?

544
00:42:59.297 --> 00:43:02.203
Doesn't it feel like
we're back in our hometown?

545
00:43:02.203 --> 00:43:06.382
- Yes.
- Paris is our second hometown.

546
00:43:06.382 --> 00:43:07.958
C'est si bon. (It's so good.)

547
00:43:09.043 --> 00:43:11.603
I will hold the Paris night tour tonight.

548
00:43:11.603 --> 00:43:12.857
Is anyone interested?

549
00:43:12.857 --> 00:43:14.005
Me!

550
00:43:14.005 --> 00:43:15.891
Us too.

551
00:43:17.014 --> 00:43:20.947
- Just the two teams?
- Not us.

552
00:43:21.444 --> 00:43:23.781
- You're so shameless.
- Why?

553
00:43:23.781 --> 00:43:25.712
Just stay still.

554
00:43:26.366 --> 00:43:28.741
Then, is it just San Ma Ru?

555
00:43:28.741 --> 00:43:31.525
Great, you can go on an evening date.

556
00:43:32.663 --> 00:43:35.081
Why did you poke me like that?

557
00:43:36.293 --> 00:43:38.960
- We'll go up now.
- Wait for us.

558
00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:41.056
- We're leaving now.
- Yes.

559
00:43:47.627 --> 00:43:51.018
Good job. You'll be blessed.

560
00:43:56.665 --> 00:43:58.165
I'm doomed.

561
00:44:04.567 --> 00:44:08.482
Aren't you being immature by
refusing to help me with my luggage?

562
00:44:09.556 --> 00:44:11.460
Can you stop frowning?

563
00:44:12.103 --> 00:44:14.543
Who taught you to talk
to your dad that way?

564
00:44:16.384 --> 00:44:19.382
- Fix your manners.
- How can I fix them all of a sudden?

565
00:44:19.382 --> 00:44:20.761
Then I won't talk to you.

566
00:44:20.761 --> 00:44:22.118
Don't bother.

567
00:44:28.991 --> 00:44:30.683
Here's the night tour fee.

568
00:44:32.087 --> 00:44:36.384
- I wanted to ride the cruise ship.
- The Seine River cruise ship?

569
00:44:36.384 --> 00:44:38.029
Great, let's go.

570
00:44:40.576 --> 00:44:44.670
How about a glass of wine
instead of sightseeing?

571
00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:47.355
- I'm in.
- I don't want snacks, though.

572
00:44:47.355 --> 00:44:48.605
That's okay.

573
00:44:48.605 --> 00:44:52.616
It's on me today. Follow me.

574
00:44:56.165 --> 00:45:00.239
I felt sorry for what happened today.

575
00:45:02.027 --> 00:45:04.250
I didn't watch her properly.

576
00:45:04.949 --> 00:45:09.868
That's true, but my wife
isn't feeling very well.

577
00:45:09.868 --> 00:45:13.159
She doesn't have a lot of energy,
and she said she felt dizzy

578
00:45:13.159 --> 00:45:16.210
so I wanted to feed her
and get her to rest...

579
00:45:16.795 --> 00:45:20.788
I'm sorry for the inconvenience
we caused you.

580
00:45:20.788 --> 00:45:22.208
Have a good night.

581
00:45:40.125 --> 00:45:42.781
How could you be like that?

582
00:45:42.781 --> 00:45:44.348
What do you mean?

583
00:45:44.348 --> 00:45:49.616
It's about earlier today. Imagine how
he felt when his daughter disappeared.

584
00:45:50.985 --> 00:45:53.110
What's the use of bringing that up again?

585
00:45:53.806 --> 00:45:54.962
At least he found her.

586
00:45:54.962 --> 00:45:57.788
How could you say you
wanted to eat in that situation?

587
00:45:57.788 --> 00:46:00.663
How could you do that to a father
who lost his daughter?

588
00:46:00.663 --> 00:46:02.578
You're a father too.

589
00:46:02.578 --> 00:46:05.456
This woman. Are you overflowing
with energy after that meal?

590
00:46:05.456 --> 00:46:09.324
- Why are you scolding me here?
- I won't scold you for long anyway.

591
00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:12.913
You won't hear it after I die.

592
00:46:12.913 --> 00:46:15.259
Stop the nonsense and sleep!

593
00:46:28.163 --> 00:46:30.996
I really hate you.

594
00:46:41.502 --> 00:46:44.944
How much money did you
lose by being so nosy?

595
00:46:44.944 --> 00:46:48.197
Don't worry about other families,
and protect your own first!

596
00:47:12.464 --> 00:47:15.556
I'll buy you a better one in the future.

597
00:47:15.556 --> 00:47:18.761
That's okay. I'm happy enough with this.

598
00:47:22.087 --> 00:47:23.940
Take it. It's a gift.

599
00:47:24.516 --> 00:47:25.915
What's this?

600
00:47:29.427 --> 00:47:32.181
It's a business card holder.
When did you buy this?

601
00:47:32.181 --> 00:47:35.049
I quickly bought it when you
went to the bathroom.

602
00:47:35.049 --> 00:47:39.806
Wow, this is so luxurious. Thank you.

603
00:47:39.806 --> 00:47:44.757
Promise you'll only use it for business
cards you'll keep for at least 10 years.

604
00:47:44.757 --> 00:47:48.451
Hey, we never know what will happen.
10 years doesn't make sense.

605
00:47:48.451 --> 00:47:51.471
That's why I want you to promise.

606
00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:55.480
Are you telling me to enter a company
instead of starting a business?

607
00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:58.706
- I'll hear about my investment tomorrow.
- I mean

608
00:47:58.706 --> 00:48:01.201
you should be consistent
with anything you do.

609
00:48:01.201 --> 00:48:04.480
- It's not like I didn't want to.
- Why are you talking that way?

610
00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:05.929
That's what you mean.

611
00:48:05.929 --> 00:48:09.337
Isn't it because I changed jobs
and had a few failed businesses?

612
00:48:09.337 --> 00:48:12.034
I want to succeed too.
I can't help that it's not working out.

613
00:48:12.034 --> 00:48:14.134
Have you ever done something
you liked for 10 years?

614
00:48:14.134 --> 00:48:16.616
I didn't have the opportunity.
I wasn't capable enough either.

615
00:48:16.616 --> 00:48:21.049
I've had a job I don't like for 10 years
because that's all I'm capable of.

616
00:48:23.574 --> 00:48:27.440
I understand. Thank you.
I'll use it well.

617
00:49:16.043 --> 00:49:17.435
How is it?

618
00:49:18.243 --> 00:49:20.824
I feel like I'm actually in France.

619
00:49:20.824 --> 00:49:23.741
Why isn't this included
in the itinerary? It's so nice.

620
00:49:23.741 --> 00:49:25.911
My boss was against it.

621
00:49:25.911 --> 00:49:27.353
Why?

622
00:49:27.353 --> 00:49:29.761
That's the real France!

623
00:49:29.761 --> 00:49:32.973
Then is the Eiffel Tower fake France?

624
00:49:32.973 --> 00:49:36.534
The itinerary is always the same.
Nothing's new.

625
00:49:36.534 --> 00:49:40.382
It's always new to people
who come here for the first time.

626
00:49:40.382 --> 00:49:43.630
Then, I'll unofficially
add it as a night tour.

627
00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:46.518
If you do, will the tourists like it?

628
00:49:46.518 --> 00:49:50.844
- It'll be killer.
- Yes, it'll all be over.

629
00:49:50.844 --> 00:49:54.688
If the rumor goes around, everyone
will add it to their package tours.

630
00:49:54.688 --> 00:49:59.634
Then all the tourists will be
everywhere taking pictures.

631
00:49:59.634 --> 00:50:02.636
Do you think the locals will like that?

632
00:50:03.424 --> 00:50:06.527
- No.
- The most important thing

633
00:50:06.527 --> 00:50:08.688
is to satisfy our travelers.

634
00:50:08.688 --> 00:50:11.290
But we have no right to steal
the locals' happiness away.

635
00:50:11.290 --> 00:50:17.612
This is a rule that people
of the tourist industry must follow.

636
00:50:18.199 --> 00:50:20.540
Your boss is a great man.

637
00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:24.842
He's usually a thoughtless person.
But he comes through once in a while.

638
00:50:25.364 --> 00:50:28.520
Are you happy when you come here?

639
00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:31.589
I don't come here to be happy

640
00:50:31.589 --> 00:50:35.413
but seeing as how
I always come here, I must like it.

641
00:50:35.413 --> 00:50:38.009
- You're a local now.
- Of course.

642
00:50:38.009 --> 00:50:39.949
It's been seven years since I moved here.

643
00:50:39.949 --> 00:50:42.458
You haven't visited home
since then, have you?

644
00:50:42.458 --> 00:50:46.719
I feel like that must be the case from
how your brother came looking for you.

645
00:50:48.009 --> 00:50:49.661
Did your brother arrive in Korea safely?

646
00:50:49.661 --> 00:50:51.168
Did you get a call?

647
00:50:55.719 --> 00:50:59.625
I still didn't get an answer
to my question yesterday.

648
00:51:00.482 --> 00:51:02.469
Do you have any interest
in going back to Korea?

649
00:51:06.462 --> 00:51:08.681
<i>I don't want to hear it! Stop it!</i>

650
00:51:08.681 --> 00:51:10.415
You shouldn't say that to your dad!

651
00:51:10.415 --> 00:51:14.556
I always think about you!
Have you ever thought about me?

652
00:51:17.915 --> 00:51:21.203
I do! I think about you every few days!

653
00:51:21.203 --> 00:51:24.496
What's the use of thinking
if you don't listen?

654
00:51:24.496 --> 00:51:27.487
- What about school?
- I've already been expelled.

655
00:51:27.487 --> 00:51:29.759
You should get your GED
and go to college!

656
00:51:29.759 --> 00:51:32.498
What are you going to do
without a high school diploma?

657
00:51:32.498 --> 00:51:34.572
That's why I'm thinking about
how to live my life!

658
00:51:34.572 --> 00:51:38.429
There's no point in thinking! Take your
GED, go to college, or study abroad!

659
00:51:38.429 --> 00:51:40.583
You always say the same thing.

660
00:51:40.583 --> 00:51:44.527
- Is there only one path to life?
- There are many! There are so many!

661
00:51:44.527 --> 00:51:47.000
So study hard and go to college!

662
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.214
If you do, you can take any path you
want and have whatever you want!

663
00:51:50.214 --> 00:51:51.831
Can't you just trust me?

664
00:51:51.831 --> 00:51:54.509
Can't you trust me and do as I say first?

665
00:51:56.094 --> 00:51:58.460
<i>[Mi Jung]</i>

666
00:52:00.790 --> 00:52:04.444
Answer your phone.
It's obvious who it is.

667
00:52:09.601 --> 00:52:11.755
Is it because I'm getting married?

668
00:52:11.755 --> 00:52:14.797
- Is that why you're rebelling?
- You're so immature!

669
00:52:14.797 --> 00:52:16.576
Fine! I won't get married!

670
00:52:16.576 --> 00:52:17.875
That's not why!

671
00:52:17.875 --> 00:52:20.616
I won't make you suffer
because I want to be happy!

672
00:52:20.616 --> 00:52:23.397
- I won't get married, okay?
- Gosh, seriously!

673
00:52:23.397 --> 00:52:24.806
Don't yell!

674
00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:28.413
- I won't get married, okay?
- Gosh, seriously!

675
00:52:28.413 --> 00:52:29.927
Don't yell!

687
00:54:40.601 --> 00:54:41.897
I love you.

I love you. I love you.

691
00:55:00.543 --> 00:55:02.871
- How was that?
- Forget it. I want to stop.

692
00:55:04.098 --> 00:55:06.938
Film it again. Watch.

693
00:55:08.335 --> 00:55:09.802
I love you.

694
00:55:10.458 --> 00:55:12.940
How was that? Killer, right?

695
00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:14.929
Kill me.

696
00:55:16.871 --> 00:55:19.663
Hey, watch this.

697
00:55:20.589 --> 00:55:23.011
I'm feeling emotional. Film me.

698
00:55:25.685 --> 00:55:27.337
<i>I love you.</i>

699
00:55:28.703 --> 00:55:31.964
What's up with his pronunciation?

700
00:55:43.730 --> 00:55:46.058
<i>I'll call you "Mom" one day.</i>

701
00:55:47.663 --> 00:55:50.493
<i>Please wait, even if it takes a while.</i>

702
00:56:00.962 --> 00:56:03.507
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Yes.

703
00:56:03.507 --> 00:56:05.089
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

704
00:56:05.089 --> 00:56:07.130
Thank you.

705
00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:09.656
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Thank you.

706
00:56:11.179 --> 00:56:12.415
What are you watching?

707
00:56:13.279 --> 00:56:15.297
A video clip of my future husband.

708
00:56:15.297 --> 00:56:17.000
Who filmed it?

709
00:56:20.998 --> 00:56:23.031
My future daughter.

710
00:56:27.250 --> 00:56:30.634
I always take your side and I love you
so much! What are you lacking?

711
00:56:30.634 --> 00:56:33.181
Why do you keep rebelling like this?

712
00:56:33.181 --> 00:56:35.632
I do everything you want!

713
00:56:37.250 --> 00:56:39.424
<i>My dad doesn't get mad at me.</i>

714
00:56:39.424 --> 00:56:41.596
He said I didn't do anything wrong.

715
00:56:43.183 --> 00:56:44.855
Did you know?

716
00:56:46.027 --> 00:56:51.663
Your dad... begged on his knees
that day at the meeting.

717
00:56:56.081 --> 00:56:57.683
I'm begging you.

718
00:56:58.592 --> 00:57:01.118
Please don't expel her.

719
00:57:03.375 --> 00:57:04.920
I'm begging you.

720
00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:08.721
I couldn't do that,
even though you're my student.

721
00:57:08.721 --> 00:57:10.764
But your dad did.

722
00:57:21.844 --> 00:57:24.668
I have to leave now. My dad is waiting.

723
00:57:24.668 --> 00:57:28.808
You were the best teacher I've ever had.

724
00:57:29.482 --> 00:57:31.735
Have a safe trip.

725
00:57:31.735 --> 00:57:34.516
And don't resent your dad because
he nags you about studying.

726
00:57:35.768 --> 00:57:39.918
There were times when I couldn't
stand him, but I never resented him.

727
00:57:39.918 --> 00:57:41.802
My dad's the same way.

728
00:57:41.802 --> 00:57:44.317
He'll never resent me.

729
00:57:45.895 --> 00:57:47.136
I'll see you.

730
00:58:01.027 --> 00:58:03.036
<i>I'll only focus on you from now on...</i>

731
00:58:06.036 --> 00:58:07.402
so study.

732
00:58:09.141 --> 00:58:12.585
You don't even understand me.
Why are you acting that way?

733
00:58:12.585 --> 00:58:16.839
Did you know it gets harder
to stand you the more you do this?

734
00:58:20.596 --> 00:58:23.125
I resent you so much.

735
00:58:25.127 --> 00:58:26.621
Really.

736
00:59:53.054 --> 00:59:54.882
Is it fun living here?

737
00:59:56.179 --> 01:00:00.076
Of course. I like it.
I like this job too.

738
01:00:00.603 --> 01:00:05.877
I thought it'd get boring. It's the same
itinerary with the same explanations.

739
01:00:05.877 --> 01:00:07.793
The people are different, though.

740
01:00:07.793 --> 01:00:11.478
It feels like a different trip
every time because of the people.

741
01:00:11.478 --> 01:00:14.989
And no one looks down on me.

742
01:00:15.603 --> 01:00:17.828
It's not a job people
should look down on.

743
01:00:17.828 --> 01:00:19.610
You know how it is.

744
01:00:19.610 --> 01:00:23.717
"A woman is working to the bone
to make money abroad."

745
01:00:23.717 --> 01:00:28.281
Do you want to hear the most
absurd thing I ever heard?

746
01:00:28.281 --> 01:00:30.279
"How did you end up like this?"

747
01:00:30.971 --> 01:00:34.087
I feel insulted when I hear that.

748
01:00:34.087 --> 01:00:36.487
I feel like something's wrong with me.

749
01:00:37.592 --> 01:00:42.630
Many people are like that.
They think professions give them rank.

750
01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:45.123
It's not like that in France.

751
01:00:45.123 --> 01:00:49.143
They don't care about what other
people think and focus on themselves.

752
01:00:49.143 --> 01:00:54.168
The most important thing is whether
I'm happy or not doing my job.

753
01:00:54.168 --> 01:00:57.576
- Are you happy too?
- Of course.

754
01:00:57.576 --> 01:01:00.413
Is that why you're not
going back to Korea?

755
01:01:02.674 --> 01:01:04.607
What are you curious about, exactly?

756
01:01:04.607 --> 01:01:06.587
It seems like you're
just hanging in there

757
01:01:06.587 --> 01:01:08.668
even though you want to go back.

758
01:01:09.719 --> 01:01:15.147
I don't know much, but I hope you
follow your heart before it's too late.

759
01:01:16.752 --> 01:01:18.708
Ma Ru.

760
01:01:18.708 --> 01:01:22.679
Guess if the telescope or
the microscope was invented first.

761
01:01:25.105 --> 01:01:27.540
- Telescope?
- Nope.

762
01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:29.029
Microscope.

763
01:01:29.029 --> 01:01:32.072
People have this kind of greed.

764
01:01:32.072 --> 01:01:34.775
They want to see
everything they can't see

765
01:01:34.775 --> 01:01:37.346
and uncover everything that's hidden.

766
01:01:38.614 --> 01:01:40.851
That's why people are scary to me.

767
01:01:40.851 --> 01:01:43.063
Especially Koreans.

768
01:01:43.063 --> 01:01:46.228
Koreans are bothered
until they uncover the truth.

769
01:01:46.826 --> 01:01:49.489
"Why aren't you going
back to Korea? Is that why?"

770
01:01:49.489 --> 01:01:51.996
"I'm right, aren't I? I was right."

771
01:01:51.996 --> 01:01:56.585
And then they become the advisor
and give me warnings.

772
01:01:56.585 --> 01:01:59.969
"It's not too late.
You should go back now."

773
01:01:59.969 --> 01:02:04.275
That's funny.
It's not like you understand.

774
01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:10.627
I didn't mean it that way.

775
01:02:11.190 --> 01:02:14.293
I always came here alone.

776
01:02:14.293 --> 01:02:16.826
This is the first time
I came with someone else.

777
01:02:16.826 --> 01:02:20.692
I liked this place so much that I wanted
to come here with someone I liked.

778
01:02:20.692 --> 01:02:22.054
But...

779
01:02:24.759 --> 01:02:26.835
this date is ruined.
