(We're honored to be on the prank.)

10
00:00:58.953 --> 00:01:00.952
(Is there anywhere you'd like to travel?)

11
00:01:01.693 --> 00:01:03.322
(Since the name of this model is Island,)

12
00:01:03.322 --> 00:01:04.792
(I should go to Ireland.)

13
00:01:05.762 --> 00:01:09.462
(The wish is granted.)

14
00:01:10.202 --> 00:01:12.232
I'll take over starting now.

(with four people who appreciate even a small thing)

30
00:01:53.087 --> 00:01:56.027
(The morning of the second day comes.)

31
00:01:58.927 --> 00:02:01.997

Your phone fell off.

41

00:03:03.226 --> 00:03:07.497
(He wakes up with a song.)

55
00:03:08.297 --> 00:03:09.867
Your hair looks ridiculous.

56
00:03:12.267 --> 00:03:13.737
What about my hair?

57
00:03:14.997 --> 00:03:17.906
What's wrong with my hair

58
00:03:18.506 --> 00:03:21.006
Hurry up.

59
00:03:21.607 --> 00:03:23.476

Shower beside him.

61

He's so relaxed on the toilet.

62
00:03:28.077 --> 00:03:29.886
My gosh.

63
00:03:30.216 --> 00:03:32.487
How can you rush it?

64
00:03:32.816 --> 00:03:35.156
(Like this)

65
00:03:35.156 --> 00:03:36.327
Go like this.

He's going like this.

67
00:03:40.057 --> 00:03:42.867
(Min Ho even enjoyed the shower.)

68
00:03:43.626 --> 00:03:45.427
That's how my dad dries his hair.

69
00:03:46.367 --> 00:03:47.737
I do that too.

70
00:03:48.196 --> 00:03:49.337
My dad too.

71
00:03:49.936 --> 00:03:52.307
- You learned it from your dads. - Me too.

72
00:03:53.577 --> 00:03:56.906
I can't believe we all showered 30 minutes before the departure.

73
00:03:57.047 --> 00:03:59.047
It's unbelievable.

74
00:04:00.117 --> 00:04:01.946
We're going to a museum.

75
00:04:01.946 --> 00:04:03.316

76
00:04:03.686 --> 00:04:04.747
Let's go.

77
00:04:06.087 --> 00:04:07.117
Good hostel.

78
00:04:07.117 --> 00:04:08.716
- Good hostel. - Number one.

79
00:04:09.686 --> 00:04:10.886
Hostel number one.

80
00:04:10.886 --> 00:04:12.396
(They head outside after a lame compliment.)

81
00:04:12.927 --> 00:04:14.357
- Let's go. - Are we walking to the museum?

82
00:04:15.126 --> 00:04:17.167
- Is it far from here? - It's not that far, is it?

83
00:04:17.367 --> 00:04:18.497
- No. - It's within walking distance.

84
00:04:18.497 --> 00:04:20.566
- Seven minutes on foot. - Let's go.

85

00:04:24.936 --> 00:04:26.136
Let's go.

87
00:04:27.336 --> 00:04:30.506
(They begin traveling as if they're back home after duty free shopping.)

88
00:04:30.506 --> 00:04:34.347
Are we supposed to travel with heavy bags?

89
00:04:34.717 --> 00:04:36.086
The weather is so nice.

90
00:04:36.946 --> 00:04:38.886
- What's weather in English? - Weather.

91
00:04:39.287 --> 00:04:40.357
Nice weather.

92
00:04:40.357 --> 00:04:41.456
(He applies "nice".)

93
00:04:42.456 --> 00:04:46.227
(It's spring in Perth.)

94
00:04:47.597 --> 00:04:51.097
(It's spring in Australia because it's opposite of Korea.)

95
00:04:51.766 --> 00:04:55.266
(Flowers, the symbols of spring bloom)

96
00:04:55.936 --> 00:04:59.807
(You can feel spring on every street.)

97
00:04:59.876 --> 00:05:03.076
(Spring. It's written explicitly.)

98
00:05:03.946 --> 00:05:06.217
(The smell of spring)

99
00:05:09.516 --> 00:05:12.816
(If you don't look down, I'm going to run towards you.)

100
00:05:13.717 --> 00:05:15.927
The birds here sound weird.

101
00:05:16.886 --> 00:05:19.557
(Crows crying all together.)

102
00:05:19.896 --> 00:05:21.026
It's weird.

103
00:05:21.026 --> 00:05:23.797
(People here cry weird.)

104
00:05:24.797 --> 00:05:27.136
(Seung Yoon keeps looking at his phone while walking.)

105
00:05:27.237 --> 00:05:28.297
Where are you going?

106
00:05:29.206 --> 00:05:30.936
- This way. - Really? That way?

107
00:05:31.307 --> 00:05:33.376
Great. Map Seung Yoon.

108
00:05:33.376 --> 00:05:35.946
(Follow me! Map Seung Yoon)

109
00:05:36.477 --> 00:05:37.576
There's a sign.

110
00:05:37.576 --> 00:05:40.276
(Min Ho's excited for some reason.)

111
00:05:40.376 --> 00:05:41.717
Should I take out the hats?

112
00:05:41.717 --> 00:05:43.386
(The phone drops.)

113
00:05:43.386 --> 00:05:44.816
(I'm very sorry, Seung Yoon.)

114
00:05:44.816 --> 00:05:46.016
Seung Yoon's upset.

115
00:05:46.386 --> 00:05:49.086
- Did it break? - Luckily, it didn't.

116
00:05:50.227 --> 00:05:52.357
(They're happy.)

117
00:05:53.727 --> 00:05:56.696
We're here because Min Ho wanted to.

118
00:05:56.696 --> 00:05:59.696
- Right. - Let's travel for Min Ho.

119
00:05:59.696 --> 00:06:00.836
- Okay. - It's here.

120
00:06:01.266 --> 00:06:02.867
- Where? This one? - This one.

121
00:06:03.367 --> 00:06:04.566
What kind of place is this?

122
00:06:04.936 --> 00:06:06.477
- This is... - Explain.

123
00:06:06.477 --> 00:06:07.636
a contemporary arts museum.

124
00:06:07.636 --> 00:06:09.247
(Contemporary arts museum. End of explanation)

125
00:06:10.876 --> 00:06:13.847
(Many of you probably know.)

126
00:06:15.177 --> 00:06:17.847
(Min Ho showed his talent in drawing on "New Journey to the West".)

127
00:06:18.547 --> 00:06:21.787
(He wore an artist hat from the 80s...)

128
00:06:22.987 --> 00:06:26.956
(and drew such good drawings instantly.)

129
00:06:28.696 --> 00:06:32.126
(Maybe that's why Min Ho kept talking about museums.)

130
00:06:32.936 --> 00:06:34.737
(That's WA arts gallery.)

131
00:06:34.737 --> 00:06:36.907
(He wanted to check out galleries every time he passed by one.)

132
00:06:37.407 --> 00:06:39.936
(Most galleries are free.)

133
00:06:39.936 --> 00:06:42.547
(Knowledge on galleries beyond the average,)

134
00:06:43.646 --> 00:06:47.276
(and a wide perspective of understanding the artist's purpose)

135
00:06:48.446 --> 00:06:51.186
(He's Artist Song in terms of art pieces.)

136
00:06:52.146 --> 00:06:55.186
(But his friends say otherwise.)

137
00:06:55.557 --> 00:06:57.956
(Honestly, he doesn't understand it either,)

138
00:06:57.956 --> 00:07:00.797
(but he keeps nodding.)

139
00:07:00.797 --> 00:07:03.867
(To look smart)

140
00:07:04.867 --> 00:07:08.066
(So we asked Artist Song who's listening seriously.)

141
00:07:08.066 --> 00:07:10.167
(Do you understand it?)

142
00:07:10.167 --> 00:07:12.436
(No.)

143
00:07:12.436 --> 00:07:15.006
(It's fine, Artist Song. Passion's what's important.)

144
00:07:15.946 --> 00:07:19.247
(At one restaurant in Jeju Island that will be revealed soon,)

145
00:07:20.217 --> 00:07:24.446
(Artist Noh put up his work of art.)

146
00:07:25.657 --> 00:07:28.657
(Hey. When are you going to finish the other five?)

147
00:07:29.386 --> 00:07:32.727
(He's going to reveal his hidden talent.)

148
00:07:33.857 --> 00:07:36.667
(Artist Song to be continued)

149
00:07:37.626 --> 00:07:39.066
- Thank you. - Thank you.

150
00:07:39.367 --> 00:07:40.766
- Hi. - Good morning.

151
00:07:40.766 --> 00:07:41.836
Hi.

152
00:07:42.537 --> 00:07:44.667
Put your hand on it, and listen to it.

153
00:07:44.667 --> 00:07:46.506
This looks interesting.

154
00:07:47.477 --> 00:07:48.737
It's electricity.

155
00:07:49.006 --> 00:07:50.807
Wait. Don't touch it yet.

156
00:07:52.917 --> 00:07:54.276
- Can I touch it? - Try.

157
00:07:54.717 --> 00:07:56.386
(Amazing)

158
00:07:56.386 --> 00:07:58.247
- Do you hear anything? - Don't lie.

159
00:07:58.646 --> 00:07:59.756
Awesome.

160
00:07:59.987 --> 00:08:01.386
(This is the sound it makes.)

161
00:08:01.386 --> 00:08:02.657
- He's right. - Does it make a sound?

162
00:08:02.657 --> 00:08:04.256
- It does. - Move your hand.

163
00:08:04.987 --> 00:08:05.997
(He touches everywhere.)

164
00:08:05.997 --> 00:08:07.057
Do you hear something?

165
00:08:07.057 --> 00:08:08.526
(All over)

166
00:08:08.526 --> 00:08:10.626
- There's nothing. - It's amazing.

167
00:08:10.626 --> 00:08:11.626
- Let me try? - Really?

168
00:08:11.626 --> 00:08:14.766
It's not that amazing but impressive.

169
00:08:16.867 --> 00:08:17.936
Let me try.

170
00:08:17.936 --> 00:08:19.737
(It's not that sexy.)

171
00:08:19.737 --> 00:08:21.076
Let me try.

172
00:08:21.076 --> 00:08:22.076
Take it off.

173
00:08:22.076 --> 00:08:23.177
(Scrubbing)

174
00:08:23.177 --> 00:08:24.247
It's comfy.

175
00:08:25.446 --> 00:08:26.516
Let me try.

176
00:08:26.516 --> 00:08:27.717
(It's not such a fidgety sound.)

177
00:08:30.347 --> 00:08:31.487
(Sniffing)

178
00:08:31.487 --> 00:08:32.617
It doesn't smell like anything.

179
00:08:32.617 --> 00:08:34.217
- It smells burnt a little. - Really?

180
00:08:34.217 --> 00:08:36.126
(He smelled something burnt at the contemporary arts museum.)

181
00:08:36.126 --> 00:08:38.626
- Gently touch the drawing. - My nose is stuffed.

182
00:08:38.626 --> 00:08:39.756
I don't smell anything.

183
00:08:39.756 --> 00:08:40.857
Is this the guide?

184
00:08:41.256 --> 00:08:42.997
It's in English. We can't read it.

185
00:08:43.926 --> 00:08:45.026
Listen.

186
00:08:45.697 --> 00:08:47.536
- Try. - The name of the artist...

187
00:08:47.967 --> 00:08:49.006
is David.

188
00:08:49.006 --> 00:08:50.837
- Okay. - His name's David.

189
00:08:51.367 --> 00:08:56.406
He works on something about sound.

190
00:08:57.006 --> 00:08:58.146
Do you hear anything?

191
00:08:58.306 --> 00:08:59.376
There's energy.

192
00:08:59.376 --> 00:09:01.646
Those are the only words you know.

193
00:09:01.947 --> 00:09:03.286
That's the kind of project it is.

194
00:09:03.847 --> 00:09:05.886
The theme here is frequency.

195
00:09:06.016 --> 00:09:07.056
- It's about frequency. - Right.

196
00:09:07.056 --> 00:09:09.626
(In another room,)

197
00:09:09.626 --> 00:09:10.886
(there's deity of sun.)

198
00:09:10.886 --> 00:09:13.256
Please do not touch.

199
00:09:14.026 --> 00:09:16.426
We could touch the other things, but not this one.

200
00:09:16.426 --> 00:09:18.766
This is hard without a description.

201
00:09:19.766 --> 00:09:20.837
What was that?

202
00:09:21.766 --> 00:09:22.766
I'm leaving.

203
00:09:22.766 --> 00:09:24.266
(Seung Hoon's not interested so he decides to escape.)

204
00:09:24.636 --> 00:09:27.737
Good, but I don't understand.

205
00:09:27.737 --> 00:09:29.546
- Understand? - I don't understand.

206
00:09:29.806 --> 00:09:31.676
It is pretty complicated...

207
00:09:31.676 --> 00:09:33.916
with scientific ideas.

208
00:09:34.117 --> 00:09:36.546
But basically, it's about energy.

209
00:09:36.546 --> 00:09:38.617
- Energy? - Electricity.

210
00:09:38.617 --> 00:09:41.756
(Unexpected 1 to 1 field trip)

211
00:09:42.187 --> 00:09:43.957
- Do you hear? - No.

212
00:09:43.957 --> 00:09:45.187
So it's like...

213
00:09:45.187 --> 00:09:48.256
(Unexpected romance)

214
00:09:48.357 --> 00:09:50.166
I can't hear on that one.

215
00:09:50.166 --> 00:09:51.227
(The machine's really broken.)

216
00:09:51.497 --> 00:09:53.097
- It's like... - It's working now.

217
00:09:53.266 --> 00:09:55.497
- It works now that the power's on. - Really?

218
00:09:55.837 --> 00:09:57.567
- Pencil. - It's done with pencils.

219
00:09:58.306 --> 00:09:59.536
That's why.

220
00:09:59.536 --> 00:10:01.676
It must be 4B.

221
00:10:02.577 --> 00:10:05.146
(Min Ho and Seung Yoon enjoy it until the end.)

222
00:10:05.516 --> 00:10:07.676
- Education studio. - It's a studio.

223
00:10:07.776 --> 00:10:10.487
This isn't working for a liberal arts major like me.

224
00:10:12.957 --> 00:10:14.187
What's this?

225
00:10:14.516 --> 00:10:17.886
(That's a fence to stop you from jumping off.)

226
00:10:18.526 --> 00:10:22.497
(He listens with amazing concentration.)

227
00:10:22.497 --> 00:10:25.097
(They run away with amazing speed.)

228
00:10:26.166 --> 00:10:28.136
- I'm getting a headache. - Me too.

229
00:10:28.136 --> 00:10:30.067
(Honor class in museum)

230
00:10:30.367 --> 00:10:31.506
I see them nodding,

231
00:10:31.506 --> 00:10:34.136
but I'm sure they don't understand even 10 percent of it.

232
00:10:34.577 --> 00:10:36.947
They probably understood about 3 percent of it.

233
00:10:36.947 --> 00:10:38.006
They're back.

234
00:10:38.006 --> 00:10:40.347
(The honor class heads this way.)

235
00:10:41.416 --> 00:10:42.987
There is more upstairs. Let's go.

236
00:10:43.847 --> 00:10:45.386
Really?

237
00:10:45.386 --> 00:10:47.317
Fine. Let's go.

238
00:10:48.187 --> 00:10:49.487
Fine.

239
00:10:50.026 --> 00:10:52.026
(Skip floor 2. It's difficult.)

240
00:10:52.087 --> 00:10:54.056
- Thank you so much. - Thank you so much.

241
00:10:54.056 --> 00:10:55.526
(They thank the teacher after class.)

242
00:10:55.526 --> 00:10:56.727
Thank you.

243
00:10:56.867 --> 00:10:58.867
- We can leave now. - Okay.

244
00:10:59.036 --> 00:11:00.766
- It was fun. - Are you satisfied?

245
00:11:00.937 --> 00:11:01.997
Yes. Good.

246
00:11:02.097 --> 00:11:03.837
- Let's go grab a burger. - Yes.

247
00:11:03.937 --> 00:11:05.437
- Good. - I'm serious.

248
00:11:05.506 --> 00:11:06.876
Let's go after getting burgers.

249
00:11:06.876 --> 00:11:08.636
(It's time to fill Seung Hoon's hunger for real.)

250
00:11:09.347 --> 00:11:10.477
- A burger restaurant? - Yes.

251
00:11:10.906 --> 00:11:12.006
Let's go. I'm hungry.

252
00:11:12.477 --> 00:11:14.477
(Actually Seung Hoon...)

253
00:11:16.016 --> 00:11:19.087
(I should've looked up good restaurants.)

254
00:11:19.187 --> 00:11:21.487
(Let's find a rice noodle restaurant.)

255
00:11:21.857 --> 00:11:24.457
(I'll choose what you'll eat today.)

256
00:11:24.457 --> 00:11:29.126
(I've found a burger restaurant with 4.4 ratings yesterday.)

257
00:11:29.126 --> 00:11:32.067
(His statistical diet based on ratings)

258
00:11:32.197 --> 00:11:33.766
What would you like for dinner?

259
00:11:34.467 --> 00:11:35.497
Pasta.

260
00:11:35.707 --> 00:11:38.737
(Okay. Just wait.)

261
00:11:39.207 --> 00:11:41.306
Hey, Chef. What's the menu?

262
00:11:41.506 --> 00:11:43.306
I'm going to make Korean food.

263
00:11:43.776 --> 00:11:46.617
(He even makes Korean food with lacking ingredients.)

264
00:11:47.676 --> 00:11:49.587
(Not only the restaurants, but he also takes care of the cooking.)

265
00:11:49.587 --> 00:11:51.717
It's like a restaurant.

266
00:11:52.046 --> 00:11:54.617
(The customers of this restaurant are gawking.)

267
00:11:55.087 --> 00:11:58.827
When I see people becoming happy from eating my food,

268
00:11:58.896 --> 00:12:01.896
it makes me want to cook.

269
00:12:02.156 --> 00:12:04.467
I'm the happiest...

270
00:12:05.026 --> 00:12:06.867
when they enjoy it.

271
00:12:07.467 --> 00:12:10.967
(When they want to eat chicken, or spicy tteokbokki,)

272
00:12:10.967 --> 00:12:14.176
(or Korean food, they look at one person.)

273
00:12:14.176 --> 00:12:16.847
(He's avoiding them.)

274
00:12:16.847 --> 00:12:18.977
It's not us who's challenging. It's Seung Hoon.

275
00:12:18.977 --> 00:12:21.546
- Am I right? - Yes.

276
00:12:21.546 --> 00:12:25.317
(Winner's human food truck, Lee Seung Hoon)

277
00:12:25.857 --> 00:12:27.916
- 6 minutes. - 6 minutes?

278
00:12:27.916 --> 00:12:28.987
(He found a good restaurant.)

279
00:12:29.827 --> 00:12:31.926
(Can't wait)

280
00:12:32.727 --> 00:12:34.126
Its theme is energy.

281
00:12:34.126 --> 00:12:35.896
(They realize the theme of the exhibition after leaving.)

282
00:12:36.227 --> 00:12:37.997
Ener...

283
00:12:37.997 --> 00:12:39.166
gies.

284
00:12:40.367 --> 00:12:42.406
(Pass by as fast as you can.)

285
00:12:42.666 --> 00:12:43.837
What's this car?

286
00:12:45.266 --> 00:12:48.136
(Rumbling)

287
00:12:48.947 --> 00:12:51.306
- Isn't that Aston Martin? - I don't know.

288
00:12:51.306 --> 00:12:54.977
- This place. - I want to check out this place.

289
00:12:55.347 --> 00:12:58.617
- Hypnotize. - That's our style.

290
00:12:59.786 --> 00:13:01.117
It's pretty nice.

291
00:13:01.556 --> 00:13:02.957
We have no money.

292
00:13:02.957 --> 00:13:05.327
Shall we play a game to shop for one person only?

293
00:13:06.056 --> 00:13:08.256
- Where is it? - Here.

294
00:13:08.256 --> 00:13:10.926
(They reached the burger restaurant Seung Hoon found.)

295
00:13:12.367 --> 00:13:13.837
- Is this the one? - Yes.

296
00:13:13.837 --> 00:13:15.166
(It's located in a quiet street.)

297
00:13:15.166 --> 00:13:16.237
Cheeseburger.

298
00:13:16.237 --> 00:13:19.276
(Traditional Australian burger restaurant)

299
00:13:19.276 --> 00:13:20.906
Finally big hand.

300
00:13:20.906 --> 00:13:22.107
Let's eat outside.

301
00:13:22.707 --> 00:13:23.847
Great.

302
00:13:24.306 --> 00:13:26.347
- Here. - Awesome.

303
00:13:26.416 --> 00:13:29.416
(They're running out of breath from outdoor tables before eating.)

304
00:13:30.286 --> 00:13:31.617
It tastes better here.

305
00:13:31.617 --> 00:13:34.717
Eating food outside tastes 1.2 times more delicious.

306
00:13:35.187 --> 00:13:37.926
This is amazing. It was such a great choice.

307
00:13:38.056 --> 00:13:39.097
Good job.

308
00:13:39.426 --> 00:13:41.126
Go in.

309
00:13:41.396 --> 00:13:42.896
(How the human food truck places an order)

310
00:13:42.896 --> 00:13:44.467
- Hello. - Hi.

311
00:13:44.827 --> 00:13:46.497
Most popular menu.

312
00:13:46.497 --> 00:13:47.837
- Most popular? - Yes.

313
00:13:47.837 --> 00:13:49.607
- The Texan. - Yes.

314
00:13:49.607 --> 00:13:52.006
- Tattoo? - Beef or chicken?

315
00:13:52.006 --> 00:13:53.006
- Beef or chicken? - Good.

316
00:13:53.006 --> 00:13:54.036
- Do you want chicken? - Chicken.

317
00:13:54.036 --> 00:13:55.406
That's always a good choice.

318
00:13:55.707 --> 00:13:56.806
2, 2.

319
00:13:56.806 --> 00:13:57.947
- Two of each? - Yes.

320
00:13:58.107 --> 00:14:00.146
Can I have double cheese?

321
00:14:00.176 --> 00:14:01.676
Go ahead then. Just for you.

322
00:14:01.676 --> 00:14:03.617
One double cheese.

323
00:14:03.747 --> 00:14:06.756
1 double cheese, 2 texans, 2 souls.

324
00:14:08.117 --> 00:14:11.126
(They ordered 5 burgers?)

325
00:14:11.126 --> 00:14:12.197
- Okay. - Yes.

326
00:14:12.457 --> 00:14:13.697
- Good. - Eat here or take out?

327
00:14:14.597 --> 00:14:16.497
(He's confused.)

328
00:14:16.766 --> 00:14:19.536
(Something's wrong, but he doesn't know about it.)

329
00:14:21.036 --> 00:14:22.266
Don't you think...

330
00:14:22.806 --> 00:14:24.837
we ordered too much?

331
00:14:25.107 --> 00:14:27.237
- How much was it? - It was almost 100 dollars.

332
00:14:27.306 --> 00:14:28.847
- 100 dollars? - 100 dollars?

333
00:14:28.947 --> 00:14:30.006
How many did we order?

334
00:14:30.176 --> 00:14:31.477
One more was added.

335
00:14:31.477 --> 00:14:33.077
- We ordered five? - Yes.

336
00:14:33.217 --> 00:14:35.176
- Really? - Let's just enjoy it.

337
00:14:35.317 --> 00:14:36.487
We ordered five?

338
00:14:36.487 --> 00:14:38.886
- You said you want double cheese. - But we don't know which is which.

339
00:14:38.886 --> 00:14:41.386
- Cancel one. - We had to cancel one,

340
00:14:41.386 --> 00:14:43.626
- Did you cancel it? - but he added it.

341
00:14:43.626 --> 00:14:46.126
I'm not fluent enough to say that.

342
00:14:47.056 --> 00:14:48.126
See?

343
00:14:48.126 --> 00:14:50.497
(Manager Kang is devastated.)

344
00:14:51.097 --> 00:14:53.867
It would've been better if we didn't come to an English speaking country.

345
00:14:54.536 --> 00:14:58.666
My English skills are revealed.

346
00:14:58.666 --> 00:15:01.506
If we went to a non English speaking country,

347
00:15:01.506 --> 00:15:04.577
I would've tried my best with body language.

348
00:15:04.577 --> 00:15:05.876
Why here?

349
00:15:06.276 --> 00:15:10.286
Let's not tie ourselves with money too much calculating this and that.

350
00:15:10.386 --> 00:15:12.087
- It's over. - But you should.

351
00:15:12.087 --> 00:15:13.386
- I know I should. - You must do it.

352
00:15:13.386 --> 00:15:15.457
You can't just skip it.

353
00:15:15.457 --> 00:15:16.827
Do that from now on.

354
00:15:16.827 --> 00:15:19.697
You can't just say it's fine when you made the mistake.

355
00:15:19.697 --> 00:15:21.457
- Don't try to skip it. - Let's just enjoy.

356
00:15:22.156 --> 00:15:24.266
- Right. Let's enjoy it. - Enjoy it.

357
00:15:24.327 --> 00:15:26.166
I'm really happy right now.

358
00:15:26.166 --> 00:15:27.636
- Me too. - I'm happy.

359
00:15:27.636 --> 00:15:29.006
- It's great. - I'm happy.

360
00:15:29.006 --> 00:15:31.207
I'm not frowning.

361
00:15:31.406 --> 00:15:32.577
It's the sun.

362
00:15:32.577 --> 00:15:34.636
We deserve to be happy.

363
00:15:34.636 --> 00:15:36.107
Because I'm happy

364
00:15:36.776 --> 00:15:37.847
(French fries arrive.)

365
00:15:37.847 --> 00:15:40.016
- We ordered one large. - It's coming.

366
00:15:41.247 --> 00:15:42.786
- Isn't it awesome? - It's delicious.

367
00:15:43.847 --> 00:15:46.087
How did they fry it to make this taste?

368
00:15:47.016 --> 00:15:48.117
Clean oil.

369
00:15:49.357 --> 00:15:50.426
Hey, guys.

370
00:15:50.426 --> 00:15:52.396
(Burgers are here.)

371
00:15:52.396 --> 00:15:54.426
The one with the soul burger?

372
00:15:54.426 --> 00:15:59.067
(Overusing exclamations)

373
00:16:00.197 --> 00:16:03.437
(Australia is the top beef exporting country.)

374
00:16:04.067 --> 00:16:07.406
(Australian French fries with burgers)

375
00:16:08.607 --> 00:16:11.847
(When you pass down the pickle hat,)

376
00:16:11.847 --> 00:16:14.916
(you see the glossy combination of the patty and cheese.)

377
00:16:15.376 --> 00:16:18.857
(Forget about calories for a second.)

378
00:16:20.087 --> 00:16:24.426
(Don't forget the chicken patty.)

379
00:16:25.626 --> 00:16:27.327
Look how glossy the bun is.

380
00:16:27.697 --> 00:16:28.926
They fried the bun.

381
00:16:28.926 --> 00:16:31.227
You know, a burger with a fried bun is really good.

382
00:16:31.227 --> 00:16:32.636
This place is...

383
00:16:33.497 --> 00:16:36.567
(They're all charging towards the giant burgers.)

384
00:16:36.837 --> 00:16:37.837
Is it good?

385
00:16:37.837 --> 00:16:39.707
(He's amazed.)

386
00:16:45.376 --> 00:16:47.817
(Despite his big mouth, he takes a small bite.)

387
00:16:47.817 --> 00:16:49.146
I can't open up my mouth.

388
00:16:50.687 --> 00:16:53.957
(How dare you)

389
00:16:56.286 --> 00:16:57.487
It's good.

390
00:16:58.386 --> 00:16:59.727
This place is very popular.

391
00:16:59.727 --> 00:17:01.056
(People line up for it.)

392
00:17:01.056 --> 00:17:04.296
I'm happy when the restaurant I searched is successful.

393
00:17:04.826 --> 00:17:05.997
It's because...

394
00:17:05.997 --> 00:17:11.506
you read all comments and ratings in specific detail.

395
00:17:11.506 --> 00:17:13.137
Still, you need a hunch.

396
00:17:14.576 --> 00:17:15.907
I have to admit I'm happy.

397
00:17:16.506 --> 00:17:17.776
This is what it means to travel.

398
00:17:18.147 --> 00:17:19.316
I'm really happy.

399
00:17:19.316 --> 00:17:23.387
We don't have to get up early or shoot a music video.

400
00:17:23.387 --> 00:17:26.157
- If we were in Korea, - Right.

401
00:17:26.157 --> 00:17:29.127
we'd have to get up at 7am, and shoot a music video.

402
00:17:29.627 --> 00:17:31.887
But we can relax tomorrow as well.

403
00:17:32.756 --> 00:17:35.096
- This is unbelievable. - I'm really happy.

404
00:17:35.096 --> 00:17:37.167
- Let's eat burgers tomorrow again. - You're the best.

405
00:17:37.727 --> 00:17:38.796
I'm happy.

406
00:17:38.796 --> 00:17:40.437
(I'm really happy.)

407
00:17:41.366 --> 00:17:42.707
We...

408
00:17:42.806 --> 00:17:44.907
need freedom.

409
00:17:45.266 --> 00:17:46.737
This is so nice.

410
00:17:46.977 --> 00:17:48.207
We get to do everything we want.

411
00:17:48.336 --> 00:17:49.477
It's great.

412
00:17:49.606 --> 00:17:50.806
It was a great idea to come here.

413
00:17:52.747 --> 00:17:55.447
I became a trainee when I was 20,

414
00:17:55.786 --> 00:17:56.816
so...

415
00:17:57.346 --> 00:18:00.457
I couldn't do anything you can when you hit 20.

416
00:18:00.457 --> 00:18:03.387
(He couldn't do the things you can when you're 20.)

417
00:18:04.487 --> 00:18:05.627
It's nice.

418
00:18:06.197 --> 00:18:07.256
Can you believe you're traveling?

419
00:18:07.356 --> 00:18:09.096
Yes. I'm happy. I'm really happy.

420
00:18:09.296 --> 00:18:12.536
Don't just think you're moving when you walk.

421
00:18:12.536 --> 00:18:14.897
- Enjoy it too. - Yes.

422
00:18:14.897 --> 00:18:17.006
- Look around as you walk. - That's nice.

423
00:18:17.006 --> 00:18:18.566
- What about pictures? - What's that?

424
00:18:18.566 --> 00:18:20.207
Do you want to take pictures over there?

425
00:18:21.437 --> 00:18:22.877
(19FF new hamburger bag pouch look)

426
00:18:22.877 --> 00:18:23.977
Great.

427
00:18:24.477 --> 00:18:26.346
- Done. Get out of the way. - Hold this.

428
00:18:27.377 --> 00:18:29.487
You must hold it to look great.

429
00:18:29.747 --> 00:18:33.116
You look like Jean Valjean. Hold on.

430
00:18:33.487 --> 00:18:34.816
You look like Jean Valjean.

431
00:18:36.026 --> 00:18:38.526
- He really looks like a tourist. - This is where you place it.

432
00:18:39.256 --> 00:18:40.497
Flex your belly, Seung Yoon.

433
00:18:41.397 --> 00:18:42.596
I have no belly.

434
00:18:44.096 --> 00:18:45.667
You're done, Seung Yoon. Out of the way.

435
00:18:46.437 --> 00:18:48.296
- I'm serious. - Move.

436
00:18:48.296 --> 00:18:49.866
I didn't even pose.

437
00:18:50.606 --> 00:18:52.207
Okay.

438
00:18:53.306 --> 00:18:54.937
Okay.

439
00:18:55.137 --> 00:18:57.247
(Handful-of-bags swag)

440
00:18:58.006 --> 00:19:00.147
(He's not being eaten.)

441
00:19:00.776 --> 00:19:03.816
It's about 900m to Perth station.

442
00:19:04.187 --> 00:19:05.387
- About 1km? - Yes.

443
00:19:06.356 --> 00:19:08.086
Do you know where it is?

444
00:19:08.516 --> 00:19:10.487
Of course I do. Seung Yoon map.

445
00:19:10.487 --> 00:19:12.427
- Map Seung Yoon? - Map Seung Yoon.

446
00:19:12.796 --> 00:19:13.796
A soccer field.

447
00:19:13.796 --> 00:19:14.997
(When other members are distracted,)

448
00:19:15.397 --> 00:19:16.427
- Would you like gum? - Yes.

449
00:19:16.427 --> 00:19:17.526
(his eyes are focused on one place.)

450
00:19:17.526 --> 00:19:19.566
- What's this? - Google map's awesome.

451
00:19:20.266 --> 00:19:22.137
It navigates on its own.

452
00:19:22.137 --> 00:19:23.866
It explains everything.

453
00:19:24.036 --> 00:19:25.437
Get off at Fremantle.

454
00:19:25.437 --> 00:19:27.576
After North Fremantle station.

455
00:19:27.576 --> 00:19:28.977
(He's captivated.)

456
00:19:29.947 --> 00:19:33.247

(moving to the next city, Fremantle, a 20 minute drive from Perth.)

458
00:19:37.487 --> 00:19:38.816
It's the ocean!

459
00:19:41.157 --> 00:19:42.227
Let's shoot it.

460
00:19:42.227 --> 00:19:43.627
(Once you see the ocean outside the train,)

461
00:19:43.627 --> 00:19:45.086
It's beautiful.

462

(With more than 70 percent of the buildings...)

465

(Relaxing cafes in cappuccino street)

470

(This place where you can relax...)

472
00:20:26.096 --> 00:20:29.066
(or be active sometimes...)

473
00:20:30.106 --> 00:20:32.776
(is the beautiful city, Fremantle.)

474
00:20:34.177 --> 00:20:37.207
(How will the four...)

475
00:20:38.247 --> 00:20:41.247
(travel this relaxing and romantic city?)

476
00:20:42.217 --> 00:20:44.217
This is Fremantle station.

477
00:20:46.286 --> 00:20:47.356
I'm off.

478
00:20:48.987 --> 00:20:49.987
Hey.

479
00:20:50.657 --> 00:20:51.887
Are you homeless?

480
00:20:52.727 --> 00:20:54.897
No. I'm home.

481
00:20:55.766 --> 00:20:56.826
Hey.

00:21:01.197 --> 00:21:03.006
- I'm going to the restroom. - Okay.

485
00:21:04.437 --> 00:21:06.207
- Watch the bags! - Yes.

486
00:21:06.477 --> 00:21:09.346
If you see anybody stealing it, bark...

487
00:21:09.747 --> 00:21:11.477
- and bite them. - Okay.

488
00:21:13.247 --> 00:21:14.576
I'm going to the restroom.

489
00:21:15.116 --> 00:21:16.516

493
00:21:23.826 --> 00:21:25.596
I know. About 20 minutes?

494

00:21:32.897 --> 00:21:37.237
(He rushes to book an accommodation.)

498
00:21:37.237 --> 00:21:38.336
It's slow.

499
00:21:39.207 --> 00:21:40.477
It's connected.

500
00:21:41.106 --> 00:21:42.707
(He presses the accommodation on the top.)

501
00:21:42.907 --> 00:21:44.147
Fremantle prison.

502
00:21:44.647 --> 00:21:46.147
- Prison. - They have rooms.

503
00:21:47.776 --> 00:21:49.147
It's cheap. It's not bad.

504
00:21:49.616 --> 00:21:50.917
- Is it four beds? - Yes.

505
00:21:50.917 --> 00:21:51.947
- 4 beds. - 4 beds?

506
00:21:51.947 --> 00:21:54.687
We're lucky they have rooms everywhere we go.

507
00:21:55.116 --> 00:21:56.157
Great.

508
00:21:56.256 --> 00:21:58.487
It's only 87 dollars per night?

509
00:21:58.727 --> 00:21:59.927
You make a pretty good choice.

510
00:22:00.127 --> 00:22:01.826
- Make a reservation. - Okay.

511
00:22:02.727 --> 00:22:04.026
- For 2 nights. - Yes.

512
00:22:04.026 --> 00:22:05.427
It adds up automatically.

513
00:22:05.497 --> 00:22:07.197
(Now that they booked the hotel,)

514
00:22:07.766 --> 00:22:09.066
(and he's up...)

515
00:22:09.167 --> 00:22:10.437
I'm tired.

516
00:22:10.566 --> 00:22:12.237
This is nice.

517
00:22:12.677 --> 00:22:14.076
This is awesome.

518
00:22:14.937 --> 00:22:17.846
(When you walk down the street outside of Fremantle station...)

519
00:22:18.276 --> 00:22:19.616
- Fremantle. Quokka. - Quokka.

520
00:22:19.616 --> 00:22:20.846
Quokka. Quokka.

521
00:22:20.846 --> 00:22:22.687
- That's cute. - Take a selfie with the quokka.

522
00:22:22.917 --> 00:22:24.286
Do it now.

523
00:22:24.286 --> 00:22:26.116
Don't pay later to do it.

524
00:22:26.116 --> 00:22:27.387
- Let's do it. - Take it now.

525
00:22:28.056 --> 00:22:29.826
A selfie with a quokka.

526
00:22:31.227 --> 00:22:33.957
(We saved money!)

527
00:22:34.657 --> 00:22:37.127
It's different from Perth.

528
00:22:37.127 --> 00:22:38.366
- Right. - It's nice.

529
00:22:39.437 --> 00:22:40.737
This place is...

530
00:22:41.937 --> 00:22:43.437
- more relaxing. - I know.

531
00:22:43.907 --> 00:22:45.036
There are no people.

532
00:22:45.576 --> 00:22:46.937
What's this tree?

533
00:22:48.576 --> 00:22:50.147
It's the sponge tree.

534
00:22:50.147 --> 00:22:51.877
(You can meet trees with sponges.)

535
00:22:52.546 --> 00:22:53.677
- Goodness. - Is that a magpie?

536
00:22:54.276 --> 00:22:57.217
No. That's a grey hair beak bird.

537
00:22:57.286 --> 00:22:59.586
It's endangered species number 344.

538
00:22:59.586 --> 00:23:01.556
- There were so many. - No.

539
00:23:01.556 --> 00:23:02.887
- They only exist in this city. - Really?

540
00:23:03.727 --> 00:23:05.086
I think it's that one.

541
00:23:06.997 --> 00:23:09.766
Are we going back to prison on our own feet?

542
00:23:09.766 --> 00:23:12.026
Yes. We're turning ourselves in.

543
00:23:14.266 --> 00:23:16.467
- What's that bus? - It's funny.

544
00:23:16.907 --> 00:23:18.137
It's prison.

545
00:23:19.137 --> 00:23:20.336
The hotel is prison.

546
00:23:21.377 --> 00:23:23.276
- There's police. - Really?

547
00:23:23.907 --> 00:23:25.177
Goodness.

548
00:23:26.594 --> 00:23:28.754
- Really? - Goodness.

549
00:23:28.754 --> 00:23:30.923
(Prison?)

550
00:23:32.193 --> 00:23:33.933
We're entering prison on our own feet.

551
00:23:34.233 --> 00:23:35.334
Are we turning ourselves in?

552
00:23:35.334 --> 00:23:36.864
(They're entering on their own in prison uniforms.)

553
00:23:36.864 --> 00:23:39.334
- What is this place? - It's like real prison.

554
00:23:40.534 --> 00:23:43.373
(A high wall isolated from the outside world)

555
00:23:43.943 --> 00:23:46.143
(A prison hallway)

556
00:23:46.143 --> 00:23:47.844
(Person who actually lived here)

557
00:23:51.784 --> 00:23:53.713
Unbelievable.

558
00:23:54.683 --> 00:23:55.784
Excuse me.

559
00:23:57.554 --> 00:23:59.623
All right. Let me get you all sorted.

560
00:23:59.623 --> 00:24:01.254
Have you been inside prison before?

561
00:24:01.594 --> 00:24:02.623
No. First time.

562
00:24:02.623 --> 00:24:04.123
First time? Very cool.

563
00:24:04.794 --> 00:24:07.163
- What are your names? - Lee.

564
00:24:08.534 --> 00:24:11.834
(A real prison renovated to a youth hostel)

565
00:24:12.534 --> 00:24:13.673
All right, you guys.

566
00:24:13.673 --> 00:24:16.104
We're wearing costumes for here.

567
00:24:17.173 --> 00:24:20.443
(They entered prison on their own.)

568
00:24:21.344 --> 00:24:23.413
- It's real prison. - It's interesting.

569
00:24:25.784 --> 00:24:30.683
(It has all the details of prison.)

570
00:24:32.153 --> 00:24:36.123
(A bedroom remodeled from a solitary cell.)

571
00:24:36.594 --> 00:24:38.623
This used to be a real prison.

572
00:24:38.864 --> 00:24:40.594
They renovated a real prison.

573
00:24:41.133 --> 00:24:42.193
Awesome.

574
00:24:42.193 --> 00:24:43.203
(Experiential backpackers)

575
00:24:44.233 --> 00:24:47.104
(They found a perfect place for their outfit.)

576
00:24:47.104 --> 00:24:48.733
It's great.

577
00:24:48.933 --> 00:24:51.473
- Come in. - Good.

578
00:24:52.544 --> 00:24:53.713
(They fall in love with the clean restroom.)

579
00:24:53.713 --> 00:24:55.344
- It's clean. - Okay.

580
00:24:55.344 --> 00:24:56.744
- There's a hair dryer. - There's a dryer.

581
00:24:56.744 --> 00:24:58.584
(They fall in love twice with the hair dryer.)

582
00:24:58.784 --> 00:25:00.314
- It's clean. - It's a lot better.

583
00:25:01.114 --> 00:25:03.883
We're staying here for two nights.

584
00:25:04.054 --> 00:25:06.324
- This room is awesome. - Let's do the laundry.

585
00:25:06.324 --> 00:25:08.994
- Okay. Do the laundry. - We need detergent.

586
00:25:09.564 --> 00:25:11.663
- Hurry up please. - A riddle.

587
00:25:13.094 --> 00:25:14.364
- "New Journey"... - "To the West".

588
00:25:15.433 --> 00:25:16.633
- Samyeon... - Choga.

589
00:25:16.633 --> 00:25:17.933
(This is Youth Over Flowers, not "New Journey to the West".)

590
00:25:18.203 --> 00:25:20.034
- Is it chogwa or choga? - Choga.

591
00:25:20.034 --> 00:25:21.604
- Come on, Jin Woo. - Fine.

592
00:25:22.804 --> 00:25:25.443
(Four letter game to do the laundry)

593
00:25:26.544 --> 00:25:28.314
- Samgo... - Gijjang.

594
00:25:29.383 --> 00:25:31.544
- Done. - It's you.

595
00:25:32.584 --> 00:25:33.854
- Myungbul... - Heojeon.

596
00:25:34.254 --> 00:25:36.524
You got it wrong.

597
00:25:36.524 --> 00:25:38.254
- It's correct. - Never mind.

598
00:25:38.554 --> 00:25:40.494
(He's embarrassed.)

599
00:25:40.524 --> 00:25:42.193
- You two do it. - Let's go.

600
00:25:42.193 --> 00:25:43.524
(They head towards the laundry room together.)

601
00:25:49.064 --> 00:25:50.504
Are you looking for the laundry?

602
00:25:50.504 --> 00:25:51.633
- Yes. - Yes.

603
00:25:52.064 --> 00:25:53.703
Turn to the right.

604
00:25:54.104 --> 00:25:55.334
- Thank you. - Thank you.

605
00:25:56.443 --> 00:25:57.544
It's here.

606
00:25:58.304 --> 00:25:59.473
Laundry. Laundry.

607
00:26:01.344 --> 00:26:02.413
Laundry.

608
00:26:03.344 --> 00:26:04.643
It's not free.

609
00:26:05.143 --> 00:26:07.754
(Put it in first.)

610
00:26:08.514 --> 00:26:10.784
- Is it free? - Yes.

611
00:26:10.854 --> 00:26:12.953
- Put a lot. - Put a lot.

612
00:26:13.123 --> 00:26:14.594
Min Ho. Put a lot.

613
00:26:15.693 --> 00:26:17.693
(One more weird guy)

614
00:26:18.163 --> 00:26:19.433
Three dollars first.

615
00:26:19.534 --> 00:26:21.994
Okay. Three dollars first.

616
00:26:22.504 --> 00:26:24.703
- Do it quick. - What about this?

617
00:26:26.433 --> 00:26:27.933
It says choose color brightness.

618
00:26:28.834 --> 00:26:30.744
Choose color brightness for dark laundry?

619
00:26:31.604 --> 00:26:32.673
What candy?

620
00:26:34.244 --> 00:26:35.713
("What candy.")

621
00:26:35.713 --> 00:26:36.844
"What candy."

622
00:26:36.943 --> 00:26:39.514
(They struggled to do the laundry.)

623
00:26:40.814 --> 00:26:41.953
Then now...

624
00:26:41.953 --> 00:26:43.324
(Manager Kang settles money.)

625
00:26:43.854 --> 00:26:46.754
(He writes down all expenses.)

626
00:26:48.223 --> 00:26:50.494
- This is nice. - There are no people.

627
00:26:53.193 --> 00:26:55.903
When will we be free over that wall?

628
00:26:57.334 --> 00:26:58.733
I want to be discharged.

629
00:27:00.203 --> 00:27:02.203
It's my first time in prison.

630
00:27:02.203 --> 00:27:03.203
I know.

631
00:27:03.203 --> 00:27:04.903
(It's weird to have that experience.)

632
00:27:05.143 --> 00:27:06.274
Why did you come here?

633
00:27:08.873 --> 00:27:10.183
I stole bread.

634
00:27:11.913 --> 00:27:14.413
- Are you Jean Valjean? - Yes.

635
00:27:15.354 --> 00:27:17.854
- Nice to meet you, Jean Valjean. - I have a story.

636
00:27:19.024 --> 00:27:20.554
Okay, what's your story?

637
00:27:22.254 --> 00:27:23.893
I'm going to beat you in table tennis.

638
00:27:24.963 --> 00:27:25.994
So what?

639
00:27:26.864 --> 00:27:28.594
Why don't we play a game?

640
00:27:30.034 --> 00:27:31.903
- Just make sure you hit it over. - It's about 110 dollars.

641
00:27:31.903 --> 00:27:33.004
(They gather in front of the table.)

642
00:27:33.004 --> 00:27:34.973
- Okay, let's do this. - Look.

643
00:27:35.074 --> 00:27:36.943
Don't rush. Hit it when it's not windy.

644
00:27:36.943 --> 00:27:39.443
Just wait until it's not windy and hit.

645
00:27:39.943 --> 00:27:41.213
Do we have a game plan?

646
00:27:42.314 --> 00:27:44.544
- Just play. - Okay.

647
00:27:45.014 --> 00:27:47.653
I'm going to show you the best teamwork of a double.

648
00:27:49.453 --> 00:27:51.084
(The rally isn't exciting at all.)

649
00:27:51.084 --> 00:27:52.123
There you go.

650
00:27:53.594 --> 00:27:55.294
- Nice! - That's it!

651
00:27:57.463 --> 00:27:59.463
(Winner's athletic ability is starting to unravel.)

652
00:27:59.963 --> 00:28:01.594
- I kicked the camera. - Hey.

653
00:28:02.064 --> 00:28:04.564
- Don't kick just because you lost. - I'm sorry.

654
00:28:05.304 --> 00:28:06.433
(Supposedly, they're playing table tennis.)

655
00:28:06.433 --> 00:28:07.873
Nice smash.

656
00:28:08.834 --> 00:28:10.344
Hey, it's our turn to serve.

657
00:28:10.403 --> 00:28:11.643
- We won! - It's our turn.

658
00:28:11.643 --> 00:28:13.873
- No, it's not. We must do it again. - We have to do it twice.

659
00:28:13.873 --> 00:28:14.913
We're right.

660
00:28:18.114 --> 00:28:20.314
Do you want to play volleyball with them? Do you want to?

661
00:28:20.514 --> 00:28:23.854
(In the next court, they're playing volleyball.)

662
00:28:25.383 --> 00:28:26.453
Excuse me.

663
00:28:27.094 --> 00:28:28.994
How about 4-on-4 volleyball?

664
00:28:29.693 --> 00:28:30.994
Do you want to play?

665
00:28:31.693 --> 00:28:33.393
(Persuading foreigners with body language and friendliness.)

666
00:28:33.393 --> 00:28:35.163
How about 4 on 4? We will make a team.

667
00:28:35.163 --> 00:28:36.364
- All right. - There are four of us.

668
00:28:37.133 --> 00:28:38.463
- Yes, sure. - Let's have a 4-on-4 match.

669
00:28:39.334 --> 00:28:40.703
- Are you serious? - Let's try this.

670
00:28:40.933 --> 00:28:42.304
It's Korea versus Europe.

671
00:28:42.774 --> 00:28:44.703
- Where are you from? - I'm from England.

672
00:28:44.703 --> 00:28:46.314
- England. Goodness. - I'm from Germany.

673
00:28:46.314 --> 00:28:47.344
Germany.

674
00:28:48.044 --> 00:28:49.383
We are not good at volleyball though.

675
00:28:49.544 --> 00:28:50.544
What about our shoes?

676
00:28:50.544 --> 00:28:52.044
- We are from South Korea. - What about our hats?

677
00:28:52.953 --> 00:28:54.754
- What do we do? What are the rules? - I don't know.

678
00:28:54.784 --> 00:28:56.453
- I don't know either. Let's play. - Hey, this...

679
00:28:57.084 --> 00:28:59.223
How many times do we need to hit the ball?

680
00:28:59.254 --> 00:29:01.153
- 1, 2, 3? - 3 times?

681
00:29:01.153 --> 00:29:02.254
- Okay. - Okay.

682
00:29:02.254 --> 00:29:04.864
- 1, 2, 3 times? 3 times? - Call it out and return it.

683
00:29:04.864 --> 00:29:06.064
Let's give this a try.

684
00:29:06.494 --> 00:29:08.094
- Let's go. - Get that.

685
00:29:08.264 --> 00:29:09.604
There you go. That's it!

686
00:29:09.864 --> 00:29:11.433
(He's screaming in joy.)

687
00:29:11.433 --> 00:29:12.804
- We won. - We got the point.

688
00:29:12.804 --> 00:29:14.034
(You said three times.)

689
00:29:14.034 --> 00:29:16.173
- One point for us! - Did we get the point?

690
00:29:16.173 --> 00:29:17.203
- 3 times. - 3 times.

691
00:29:17.203 --> 00:29:18.973
- We must hit 3 times. - We can't return it at our 2nd hit.

692
00:29:19.074 --> 00:29:20.473
(He already forgot about the rule.)

693
00:29:20.673 --> 00:29:22.274
- Sorry. We didn't know. I'm sorry. - That's okay.

694
00:29:22.274 --> 00:29:24.514
- Let's do it one more time. - I'm sorry. We didn't know.

695
00:29:24.883 --> 00:29:26.014
Three times, guys. Get it.

696
00:29:26.014 --> 00:29:27.084
(Shouting)

697
00:29:27.314 --> 00:29:28.514
Hey, hey. You.

698
00:29:29.653 --> 00:29:31.723
- Two hits would be easier... - Okay.

699
00:29:31.784 --> 00:29:32.893
- if everyone's okay with that. - Sure.

700
00:29:32.893 --> 00:29:34.324
Hey, he said two hits would be easier.

701
00:29:34.324 --> 00:29:36.393
- We can return it after 2 hits. - Okay. 2 hits.

702
00:29:36.393 --> 00:29:37.524
Okay, okay.

703
00:29:37.524 --> 00:29:39.064
(Let's go!)

704
00:29:40.393 --> 00:29:41.433
Get it, Min Ho.

705
00:29:41.433 --> 00:29:43.163
(Slapstick comedy)

706
00:29:44.304 --> 00:29:46.133
My gosh, this is embarrassing.

707
00:29:46.173 --> 00:29:48.034
- This is utterly embarrassing. - Darn.

708
00:29:48.034 --> 00:29:49.643
- We're a disgrace to our country. - I'm so embarrassed.

709
00:29:49.673 --> 00:29:50.943
Get it, get it!

710
00:29:51.074 --> 00:29:54.744
(They show their poor athletic skills without any concealment.)

711
00:29:55.473 --> 00:29:56.483
Hey, hey, hey.

712
00:29:56.483 --> 00:29:57.844
(Volleyball turns into kickball.)

713
00:29:57.844 --> 00:29:58.983
(The ball almost escapes prison.)

714
00:29:59.453 --> 00:30:00.983
(Seung Yoon serves,)

715
00:30:02.683 --> 00:30:04.223
(and hits the camera.)

716
00:30:04.223 --> 00:30:05.284
Two points.

717
00:30:05.824 --> 00:30:07.423
- I'd like to circle. - Okay, okay.

718
00:30:07.423 --> 00:30:09.324
Let's circle around. Okay!

719
00:30:09.463 --> 00:30:10.794
Hey, come here. Let's circle.

720
00:30:10.794 --> 00:30:12.994
(Hey, we need to switch our places too.)

721
00:30:13.163 --> 00:30:15.034
- You're acting like you know this. - What?

722
00:30:16.004 --> 00:30:17.034
- Seung Yoon. - Get it.

723
00:30:17.163 --> 00:30:18.973
- Okay. - Get it over the net.

724
00:30:19.903 --> 00:30:23.104
(They score their first point at last.)

725
00:30:23.244 --> 00:30:25.203
Let's get this right. We can win this.

726
00:30:26.014 --> 00:30:27.014
I got it.

727
00:30:29.844 --> 00:30:30.983
- Okay. - Nice.

728
00:30:31.284 --> 00:30:32.913
(After a long rally...)

729
00:30:32.913 --> 00:30:34.114
- Nice job. - You got it!

730
00:30:34.453 --> 00:30:35.754
- No! - Is the ball out?

731
00:30:35.854 --> 00:30:37.354
- It was out. - Please give me one point.

732
00:30:37.953 --> 00:30:39.024
Please.

733
00:30:39.123 --> 00:30:40.494
(Fine. We'll give you a point.)

734
00:30:40.494 --> 00:30:41.923
(Take the ball too)

735
00:30:42.223 --> 00:30:43.594
- Nice. - Thank you!

736
00:30:43.594 --> 00:30:45.024
- Good job. - Seung Hoon.

737
00:30:45.024 --> 00:30:47.393
- Well done. - The only thing we lack is money.

738
00:30:47.393 --> 00:30:49.534
That's right. I made that one count. I got us a point!

739
00:30:49.534 --> 00:30:51.004
- Good job. - I got us a point.

740
00:30:51.203 --> 00:30:52.304
Come on, Korea!

741
00:30:52.534 --> 00:30:53.873
Come on. We can do this, Korea!

742
00:30:55.943 --> 00:30:57.004
- I got it. - Okay.

743
00:30:57.173 --> 00:30:58.173
- Okay. - That was nice.

744
00:30:58.173 --> 00:30:59.373
- Nice. - Nice. That was good.

745
00:30:59.544 --> 00:31:00.574
I'm blocking it!

746
00:31:00.574 --> 00:31:01.844
(Using his whole body)

747
00:31:02.683 --> 00:31:03.814
I think that was our best rally.

748
00:31:04.284 --> 00:31:05.653
You did everything by yourself.

749
00:31:07.014 --> 00:31:08.084
Mine.

750
00:31:08.084 --> 00:31:09.453
(4 acts of slapstick comedy)

751
00:31:09.453 --> 00:31:10.554
Hit it!

752
00:31:11.254 --> 00:31:13.923
(These youthful singers seem to have gone back to their childhood.)

753
00:31:14.693 --> 00:31:15.764
Is this it? Did we win?

754
00:31:15.764 --> 00:31:17.364
- Yes, you guys won. - Yes.

755
00:31:17.364 --> 00:31:18.623
- Thank you. - Thank you.

756
00:31:18.623 --> 00:31:20.094
- This game's over now. Thank you. - Good game.

757
00:31:20.264 --> 00:31:21.364
You were a good player.

758
00:31:21.364 --> 00:31:22.564
(Acting like national players)

759
00:31:22.564 --> 00:31:24.433
- Good game. - Thank you.

760
00:31:24.663 --> 00:31:26.574
- Thank you. - What do you guys do?

761
00:31:26.834 --> 00:31:28.203
We are Korean singers.

762
00:31:29.074 --> 00:31:30.473
- Who are you? - We are Winner.

763
00:31:30.473 --> 00:31:31.673
- Winner? - Yes.

764
00:31:31.844 --> 00:31:32.913
Hey, we lost!

765
00:31:32.913 --> 00:31:34.044
(Chuckling)

766
00:31:34.213 --> 00:31:36.183
- Our name is Winner, but we lost. - We are losers.

767
00:31:36.784 --> 00:31:37.983
We lost the volleyball match.

768
00:31:38.284 --> 00:31:39.854
What's worse is they went easy on us.

769
00:31:40.453 --> 00:31:44.223
(Winner must be banned from playing sports or starring on sports shows.)

770
00:31:44.354 --> 00:31:47.554
(After ending a physically demanding game...)

771
00:31:47.824 --> 00:31:48.893
Min Ho.

772
00:31:50.364 --> 00:31:51.923
- It's about skydiving. - Sorry?

773
00:31:51.923 --> 00:31:53.594
Let's go and make reservations for skydiving.

774
00:31:53.794 --> 00:31:55.864
- To where? How? - Let's ask...

775
00:31:56.364 --> 00:31:57.663
- how we can do that. - Let's do that.

776
00:31:57.663 --> 00:31:59.074
Let's ask the receptionist.

777
00:31:59.433 --> 00:32:00.973
- The receptionist? - Yes.

778
00:32:01.633 --> 00:32:02.744
Come with me.

779
00:32:03.403 --> 00:32:06.413
(There's a sad story behind skydiving.)

780
00:32:07.574 --> 00:32:09.413
(This was before they departed for Australia.)

781
00:32:10.744 --> 00:32:12.713
(Winner was looking through the guide book.)

782
00:32:13.754 --> 00:32:15.953
(They found skydiving in the list of activities they can enjoy.)

783
00:32:16.683 --> 00:32:18.554
(Screaming in joy)

784
00:32:19.524 --> 00:32:21.623
(Jin Woo seemed especially excited.)

785
00:32:22.564 --> 00:32:25.024
(Jin Woo is the center of this tearful story.)

786
00:32:25.864 --> 00:32:28.463
(A little while ago, Winner filmed...)

787
00:32:29.433 --> 00:32:32.334
(a video for their fans overseas.)

788
00:32:32.933 --> 00:32:35.373
I saw we were supposed to go skydiving on the itinerary.

789
00:32:35.504 --> 00:32:38.473
I wanted to try skydiving...

790
00:32:38.973 --> 00:32:40.814
and went on the trip with hopes of skydiving.

791
00:32:40.814 --> 00:32:42.074
(He was excited during the shoot.)

792
00:32:42.344 --> 00:32:44.344
I can't believe I'm going skydiving.

793
00:32:44.344 --> 00:32:46.784
Skydiving? My goodness.

794
00:32:46.784 --> 00:32:48.683
Jin Woo kept talking about skydiving...

795
00:32:48.683 --> 00:32:50.923
- even before we came to Guam. - He really wants to try it.

796
00:32:51.024 --> 00:32:53.923
I was informed that everyone would go skydiving.

797
00:32:54.193 --> 00:32:57.223
"All four of you will go skydiving. Don't you worry."

798
00:32:57.264 --> 00:32:58.463
That's what I was told.

799
00:32:58.994 --> 00:33:00.433
- No way. - What are those?

800
00:33:00.433 --> 00:33:02.933
(Out of nowhere, a game of luck was presented.)

801
00:33:03.104 --> 00:33:04.304
(Jin Woo and Seung Hoon lost their chance.)

802
00:33:04.304 --> 00:33:05.463
Are you serious?

803
00:33:05.463 --> 00:33:07.074
(I'm not going to film now. I'm serious.)

804
00:33:07.074 --> 00:33:08.304
I'm going to take off the microphone.

805
00:33:08.403 --> 00:33:09.704
This is so disappointing.

806
00:33:10.144 --> 00:33:11.874
The crew basically played me.

807
00:33:13.344 --> 00:33:14.344
They really did.

808
00:33:14.514 --> 00:33:16.583
At that time, I just wanted to go back to Korea right away.

809
00:33:16.844 --> 00:33:17.914
I'm not lying.

810
00:33:18.014 --> 00:33:19.284
When he couldn't do it, he was...

811
00:33:19.284 --> 00:33:21.313
- really mad. - After we played the game,

812
00:33:21.313 --> 00:33:23.023
we cursed the program, "One Night Two Days"...

813
00:33:23.023 --> 00:33:24.954
for making those games of luck.

814
00:33:25.693 --> 00:33:27.023
And the producer of the show is right here.

815
00:33:27.023 --> 00:33:28.293
It was like a butterfly effect.

816
00:33:28.293 --> 00:33:30.364
(He's the cause of this misfortune.)

817
00:33:31.994 --> 00:33:34.434
Even after the shoot, I kept wanting to try skydiving.

818
00:33:34.894 --> 00:33:35.963
(Jin Woo wished to try it once.)

819
00:33:35.963 --> 00:33:37.233
I wanted to try it.

820
00:33:38.934 --> 00:33:41.133
- People go on trips. - Skydiving.

821
00:33:41.133 --> 00:33:42.443
- We must try it. - People who don't know...

822
00:33:42.443 --> 00:33:43.773
Let's do it when the sky is clear.

823
00:33:44.103 --> 00:33:45.344
We should go to Fremantle.

824
00:33:45.344 --> 00:33:47.844
There's an island we can reach by a 30-minute boat ride.

825
00:33:47.844 --> 00:33:49.844
(They found out they can go skydiving on Rottnest Island.)

826
00:33:49.844 --> 00:33:52.313
- We can do it on the island. - That's where we can go skydiving.

827
00:33:53.284 --> 00:33:54.383
We must go there then.

828
00:33:55.554 --> 00:33:56.983
I think it's going to cost a lot.

829
00:33:56.983 --> 00:33:58.284
I should look up the prices.

830
00:33:59.394 --> 00:34:00.554
It's so expensive.

831
00:34:00.853 --> 00:34:02.153
It's 300 dollars.

832
00:34:02.423 --> 00:34:04.023
- What costs 300 dollars? - The skydiving.

833
00:34:04.224 --> 00:34:06.164
- 300 dollars? - We can't afford it.

834
00:34:06.164 --> 00:34:07.463
(They're shocked.)

835
00:34:08.233 --> 00:34:09.434
I want to see the stars.

836
00:34:10.764 --> 00:34:12.133
You won't go skydiving?

837
00:34:12.133 --> 00:34:14.273
We can't go skydiving. It's too expensive.

838
00:34:15.103 --> 00:34:17.574
I can't use our budget just for my own happiness.

839
00:34:19.173 --> 00:34:20.914
- Because it costs 300 dollars? - Yes, it costs 300 dollars.

840
00:34:20.914 --> 00:34:22.983
(And Jin Woo gave up on skydiving once again.)

841
00:34:23.883 --> 00:34:26.083
(However, the younger members couldn't give up on it.)

842
00:34:26.883 --> 00:34:30.684
I really want Jin Woo to go skydiving though.

843
00:34:30.684 --> 00:34:32.594
- I don't have to go skydiving. - It's not scary.

844
00:34:32.594 --> 00:34:34.023
- Really? - I'm not sure about Min Ho, but...

845
00:34:34.054 --> 00:34:37.563
The reason I wanted to save money today was...

846
00:34:37.563 --> 00:34:39.934
because I wanted us to do activities we want.

847
00:34:39.934 --> 00:34:41.633
We would need money to do those activities.

848
00:34:41.833 --> 00:34:43.704
- But... - If money isn't an issue,

849
00:34:43.704 --> 00:34:45.034
can all of us go?

850
00:34:45.034 --> 00:34:47.534
Of course. That would be much better.

851
00:34:48.633 --> 00:34:51.543
If I were to choose an activity, I'd like us to go skydiving together.

852
00:34:51.543 --> 00:34:52.914
I'm not interested in other ones.

853
00:34:52.914 --> 00:34:55.273
We can't go skydiving without making reservations first.

854
00:34:55.273 --> 00:34:57.284
(They decided to make a bold investment in skydiving.)

855
00:34:59.184 --> 00:35:00.284
(Jin Woo and Min Ho go to ask about skydiving.)

856
00:35:00.284 --> 00:35:01.353
Excuse me.

857
00:35:01.353 --> 00:35:04.253
- Hi, guys. - It's about skydiving.

858
00:35:04.824 --> 00:35:06.054
- Is it for tomorrow? - Tomorrow?

859
00:35:06.054 --> 00:35:07.454
- Yes, it's for tomorrow. - Yes.

860
00:35:07.454 --> 00:35:08.454
Okay.

861
00:35:09.364 --> 00:35:12.124
They only have those times available.

862
00:35:12.124 --> 00:35:13.733
- Does "am" means evening? - No, it's morning.

863
00:35:13.733 --> 00:35:15.293
Oh, you're right.

864
00:35:15.494 --> 00:35:19.503
For Geronimo, they don't have any pricing online.

865
00:35:19.534 --> 00:35:22.204
You have to call them if you want to book with Rottnest Skydiving.

866
00:35:22.204 --> 00:35:23.273
Okay

867
00:35:26.414 --> 00:35:27.574
Should we call this number?

868
00:35:27.574 --> 00:35:28.914
Why don't you give them a call?

869
00:35:30.083 --> 00:35:31.213
(They're afraid to talk to a foreigner.)

870
00:35:31.213 --> 00:35:32.284
Okay.

871
00:35:32.284 --> 00:35:34.514
You want me to call? My English isn't good.

872
00:35:35.284 --> 00:35:36.624
Why don't we give this a shot?

873
00:35:37.923 --> 00:35:39.594
- It's working. - It's going through.

874
00:35:39.594 --> 00:35:40.793
- It popped up. - Right.

875
00:35:40.923 --> 00:35:42.824
- I'm hearing beeps. - Thanks for calling Geronimo.

876
00:35:42.994 --> 00:35:44.994
The best skydiving experience guaranteed.

877
00:35:44.994 --> 00:35:46.994
- This is an answering machine. - I think so too.

878
00:35:47.193 --> 00:35:48.193
- To speak with information... - Hello?

879
00:35:48.193 --> 00:35:49.204
(Is anyone there?)

880
00:35:49.364 --> 00:35:51.003
- For booking, press one. - I heard, "booking".

881
00:35:51.903 --> 00:35:53.403
(They press 1 after hearing "booking".)

882
00:35:53.403 --> 00:35:54.503
- What is this? - Booking.

883
00:35:55.673 --> 00:35:58.244
(Someone answers the phone.)

884
00:35:58.244 --> 00:35:59.374
Hello.

885
00:35:59.673 --> 00:36:00.713
Hi.

886
00:36:01.173 --> 00:36:03.344
I want to go skydiving.

887
00:36:03.914 --> 00:36:04.943
- Yes. - Okay?

888
00:36:04.943 --> 00:36:07.383
- Four of us want to do it tomorrow. - In the morning.

889
00:36:07.753 --> 00:36:08.883
Is your team available?

890
00:36:09.054 --> 00:36:11.954
Yes, definitely. Is this for Busselton or Rottnest Island?

891
00:36:13.653 --> 00:36:14.793
Excuse me?

892
00:36:15.594 --> 00:36:18.423
We have two places.

893
00:36:18.824 --> 00:36:20.233
One is Rottnest Island.

894
00:36:20.233 --> 00:36:22.434
- We'd like it on Rottnest Island. - Rottnest Island.

895
00:36:22.603 --> 00:36:24.403
- Okay, cool. - Yes!

896
00:36:25.204 --> 00:36:26.233
Let me mark it on our calendar.

897
00:36:26.233 --> 00:36:28.804
(With only a few English words, they managed to book a reservation.)

898
00:36:28.804 --> 00:36:33.614
At what altitude would you like to jump from?

899
00:36:34.014 --> 00:36:36.684
Your choices are 10,000ft, 14,000ft,

900
00:36:36.684 --> 00:36:38.483
- and 15,000ft. - Which one is the highest one?

901
00:36:38.784 --> 00:36:40.014
- The highest? - Yes.

902
00:36:40.813 --> 00:36:42.684
That would be 15,000ft.

903
00:36:42.684 --> 00:36:43.824
Good.

904
00:36:43.824 --> 00:36:45.023
- Isn't that too high? - Okay.

905
00:36:45.023 --> 00:36:47.923
(It's the highest altitude to go up without an oxygen tank.)

906
00:36:48.494 --> 00:36:49.693
- Credit card. - I hear someone in the background.

907
00:36:49.693 --> 00:36:51.063
(They borrow the staff's card for deposit.)

908
00:36:51.063 --> 00:36:52.894
(He's ecstatic.)

909
00:36:53.664 --> 00:36:55.494
(They give high-fives to each other as force of habit.)

910
00:36:55.864 --> 00:36:56.963
- Okay, bye. - Thank you.

911
00:36:56.963 --> 00:36:58.264
- Thank you. - See you tomorrow.

912
00:36:58.804 --> 00:37:00.673
- Did it go well? - Yes, I think we booked it.

913
00:37:01.833 --> 00:37:03.344
Let's check if we got the confirmation email...

914
00:37:03.344 --> 00:37:05.003
- or not. - We should check our emails.

915
00:37:05.003 --> 00:37:07.474
- We did it. - We must take the ferry at 8am.

916
00:37:07.673 --> 00:37:09.744
We should calculate the time here to the harbor too.

917
00:37:10.043 --> 00:37:11.414
- To Korea? - Why are we going to Korea?

918
00:37:11.514 --> 00:37:13.353
- I said, "harbor". - I see. Harbor.

919
00:37:13.454 --> 00:37:15.054
- I thought he said, "Korea". - So did I.

920
00:37:16.054 --> 00:37:17.224
Bye.

921
00:37:17.224 --> 00:37:19.293
- The ferries will be at the harbor. - Harbor.

922
00:37:19.454 --> 00:37:21.023
We need to go to the harbor to take the ferry.

923
00:37:21.023 --> 00:37:23.864
We can ask the receptionist. She's really nice.

924
00:37:23.864 --> 00:37:25.224
- She is nice. - I think we can ask her.

925
00:37:25.224 --> 00:37:26.594
- She even wrote this down for us. - Okay.

926
00:37:28.034 --> 00:37:31.333
(And they managed to book their tickets for the ferry as well.)

927
00:37:34.173 --> 00:37:37.503
(The dawn breaks the next day.)

928
00:37:39.414 --> 00:37:41.344
(He gets up.)

929
00:37:42.644 --> 00:37:45.244
(Jin Woo wakes up.)

930
00:37:46.753 --> 00:37:49.923
(He gets ready with the thought of going skydiving.)

931
00:37:50.284 --> 00:37:52.454
- How much time do we have left? - Until we have to leave?

932
00:37:53.023 --> 00:37:54.494
We have exactly an hour.

933
00:37:55.253 --> 00:37:56.324
Let me take a shower first.

934
00:37:57.793 --> 00:38:01.934
(3 alarms on different phones go off except for Jin Woo's.)

935
00:38:02.333 --> 00:38:03.403
(Chuckling)

936
00:38:03.733 --> 00:38:04.804
Darn.

937
00:38:04.804 --> 00:38:06.474
(No one can get up except Jin Woo.)

938
00:38:07.233 --> 00:38:08.974
Everyone's alarms started to go off.

939
00:38:09.804 --> 00:38:11.074
Hey, guys. Wash up.

940
00:38:12.074 --> 00:38:13.443
- Wash up. - Okay.

941
00:38:13.844 --> 00:38:16.043
We have 30 minutes. No, we have 20.

942
00:38:17.383 --> 00:38:20.153
Should I bring my swimming shorts just in case?

943

944
00:38:25.894 --> 00:38:28.793
(It's a fairy-tale-like island located in West Australia.)

945
00:38:30.193 --> 00:38:33.434
(The most popular vacation spot of locals for the weekend)

946
00:38:34.534 --> 00:38:37.603
(To protect the environment, only tour buses and bikes are allowed.)

(Personal automobile use is not permitted.)

948
00:38:42.273 --> 00:38:44.474
(And most of all, the biggest charm of this island is that...)

949
00:38:45.043 --> 00:38:49.543
(it's full of various activities such as skydiving.)

950
00:38:50.543 --> 00:38:53.014
(Whenever the sun sets,)

951
00:38:55.824 --> 00:38:57.923
(a magical view of the sunset unfolds.)

952
00:38:59.094 --> 00:39:02.764
(White sand and the blue Indian Ocean meets...)

953
00:39:02.764 --> 00:39:05.733
(on Rottnest Island.)

954

(Everyone has woken up.)

956
00:39:13.974 --> 00:39:17.403
(Min Ho takes something out as soon as he wakes up.)

957
00:39:19.713 --> 00:39:22.213
(It's the burger their lack of English proficiency caused.)

958
00:39:22.744 --> 00:39:24.983
Don't eat! You can't eat that!

959
00:39:28.353 --> 00:39:29.624
Let me have a bite.

960
00:39:29.624 --> 00:39:31.284
What's that? Where did you get that?

961
00:39:31.784 --> 00:39:32.954
It's from yesterday.

962
00:39:33.824 --> 00:39:34.824
The burger is huge.

963
00:39:35.494 --> 00:39:36.494
Is it good?

964
00:39:36.494 --> 00:39:38.894
(Jin Woo takes a bite before they go skydiving.)

965
00:39:41.664 --> 00:39:44.864
(It's time to take the ferry heading to Rottnest Island.)

966
00:39:46.374 --> 00:39:48.003
There isn't a single cloud...

967
00:39:48.204 --> 00:39:49.403
- in the sky today. - I know.

968
00:39:49.943 --> 00:39:52.043
It's a great day to jump.

969
00:39:52.943 --> 00:39:54.713
Nothing will get in our way when we jump.

970
00:39:56.213 --> 00:39:57.213
That's the ferry.

971
00:39:57.213 --> 00:39:58.583
(They get a glimpse of the harbor.)

972
00:40:01.684 --> 00:40:03.483
- Cheers. - Cheers.

973
00:40:03.853 --> 00:40:06.954
- Cheers. - Why did we say at the same time?

974
00:40:06.954 --> 00:40:07.954
We said it in unison.

975
00:40:08.793 --> 00:40:10.324
- Thank you. - Let's go.

976
00:40:10.394 --> 00:40:12.094
(They set out to skydive.)

977
00:40:12.094 --> 00:40:13.534
Gosh, the sky is so clear.

978
00:40:16.034 --> 00:40:18.364
My gosh. I might be able to see the space from here.

979
00:40:19.633 --> 00:40:21.733
- That's the ferry for 8:15am. - It was so easy to get here.

980
00:40:21.733 --> 00:40:24.043
- That's the one for 8:15am. - We managed to get here.

981
00:40:24.773 --> 00:40:26.644
I won't get off my bicycle today.

982
00:40:26.813 --> 00:40:28.574
- Thanks, guys. Have a good day. - Thank you.

983
00:40:28.644 --> 00:40:30.344
- Have a good day. - Thank you.

984
00:40:30.914 --> 00:40:32.244
(They will take the 2-story ferry to the island.)

985
00:40:32.244 --> 00:40:33.483
Do we have assigned seats?

986
00:40:35.554 --> 00:40:37.054
- Let's sit here and there. - Over there.

987
00:40:37.324 --> 00:40:38.423
- All right. - This one.

988
00:40:39.124 --> 00:40:40.653
- Let's sit down. - I'm nervous.

989
00:40:41.894 --> 00:40:44.094
(He's tired.)

990
00:40:44.094 --> 00:40:45.124
Let's take a selfie.

991
00:40:47.094 --> 00:40:48.094
Say cheese.

992
00:40:48.164 --> 00:40:49.563
(He forces a smile.)

993
00:40:50.003 --> 00:40:51.503
(Everyone seems exhausted.)

994
00:40:51.704 --> 00:40:53.204
We totally look like tourists.

995
00:40:54.133 --> 00:40:55.204
But we are tourists.

996
00:40:56.574 --> 00:40:59.514
(The ferry ventures out with exhausted tourists.)

997
00:41:01.374 --> 00:41:03.043
(They pass out.)

998
00:41:04.983 --> 00:41:06.653
(Jin Woo is the only one who wakes up again.)

999
00:41:07.153 --> 00:41:08.713
(Skydiving...)

1000
00:41:09.483 --> 00:41:11.954
(It takes about 20 minutes via ferry from Fremantle...)

1001
00:41:11.954 --> 00:41:13.554
(to Rottnest Island.)

1002
00:41:14.324 --> 00:41:17.394
(They arrive at Rottnest Island.)

1003
00:41:22.633 --> 00:41:27.173
(The amazing weather on the island washes away their exhaustion.)

1004
00:41:28.833 --> 00:41:31.244
But we have a lot of time left.

1005
00:41:32.344 --> 00:41:33.543
We have plenty of time.

1006
00:41:33.543 --> 00:41:35.344
- Let's rent a bicycle. - Let's rent it first.

1007
00:41:36.184 --> 00:41:37.644
- Let's take it with us. - Let's rent a bicycle.

1008
00:41:37.644 --> 00:41:38.684
- Hi. - Hello.

1009
00:41:39.614 --> 00:41:40.813
- 4? - Yes, 4 bikes, please.

1010
00:41:41.753 --> 00:41:42.753
Hey, take your bicycle.

1011
00:41:45.554 --> 00:41:46.554
This fits perfectly.

1012
00:41:46.954 --> 00:41:47.954
Let me buckle you up.

1013
00:41:48.454 --> 00:41:50.023
- I'm ready. - You already did it.

1014
00:41:50.423 --> 00:41:51.594
I'm always ready.

1015
00:41:52.693 --> 00:41:54.664
- Let's go. - Let's go!

1016
00:41:54.994 --> 00:41:56.963
- Let's go. - Go, go, go.

1017
00:41:56.963 --> 00:41:58.804
(This must be mentioned when discussing Rottnest Island.)

1018
00:41:59.374 --> 00:42:00.403
Hey, quokka.

1019
00:42:01.434 --> 00:42:03.943
(Quokka?)

1020
00:42:04.744 --> 00:42:05.914
(Did you call me?)

1021
00:42:06.443 --> 00:42:07.943
(I'm a quokka. I'm an animal.)

1022
00:42:09.313 --> 00:42:11.514
(I'm the happiest animal in the world.)

1023
00:42:13.184 --> 00:42:16.284
(It's a type of kangaroos and only inhabits on Rottnest Island.)

1024
00:42:17.583 --> 00:42:19.293
(They are known to be nosy.)

1025
00:42:20.423 --> 00:42:21.653
(What's happening there?)

1026
00:42:23.164 --> 00:42:25.894
(What do you think this boy is doing?)

1027
00:42:25.894 --> 00:42:27.833
(Here's a hint.)

1028
00:42:27.833 --> 00:42:29.764
(He's taking a selfie with a quokka.)

1029
00:42:31.733 --> 00:42:34.574
(Taking a selfie with a quokka is on the bucket list of travelers.)

1030
00:42:36.043 --> 00:42:37.374
(Is it hard to take a selfie?)

1031
00:42:37.374 --> 00:42:38.374
(Yes.)

1032
00:42:39.874 --> 00:42:41.614
(Beware of horrible photos. Quokka, please put your head up.)

1033
00:42:41.614 --> 00:42:43.443
(This is the life of the most famous animal in Australia.)

1034
00:42:44.043 --> 00:42:47.253
(Besides, they are nocturnal and like to stay in.)

1035
00:42:48.983 --> 00:42:51.554
(No, I'm not sleeping.)

1036
00:42:52.923 --> 00:42:54.523
(Try to find me.)

1037
00:42:55.523 --> 00:42:58.394
(Can they manage to take a selfie with a quokka before skydiving?)

1038
00:42:59.594 --> 00:43:02.233
(Seung Yoon and Min Ho around the forest first.)

1039
00:43:04.103 --> 00:43:05.434
(Quokkas are often spotted under the trees.)

1040
00:43:05.434 --> 00:43:06.434
Hey, quokka.

1041
00:43:08.534 --> 00:43:11.374
(Where are quokkas?)

1042
00:43:12.713 --> 00:43:13.813
"Finding Quokkas".

1043
00:43:14.773 --> 00:43:16.383
(Cawing)

1044
00:43:16.383 --> 00:43:19.213
I don't see any quokkas. I only see crows.

1045
00:43:19.954 --> 00:43:22.184
(But he's still having fun.)

1046
00:43:23.423 --> 00:43:25.853
(Where on earth are quokkas?)

1047
00:43:27.793 --> 00:43:29.124
It's nice to ride a bicycle here.

1048
00:43:30.994 --> 00:43:33.894
(Seung Hoon looks around his surroundings.)

1049
00:43:37.463 --> 00:43:39.534
- Did you find a quokka? Where? - Wait.

1050
00:43:39.603 --> 00:43:40.974
- It's sitting like a rock. - That's a quokka.

1051
00:43:41.503 --> 00:43:43.474
(He's excited.)

1052
00:43:43.474 --> 00:43:44.574
That's a quokka.

1053
00:43:44.644 --> 00:43:46.813
- There's another one here. Where? - It's right in front of you.

1054
00:43:47.173 --> 00:43:48.213
It looks like a rock.

1055
00:43:49.213 --> 00:43:51.213
- Quokka. - I found a wild quokka.

1056
00:43:51.713 --> 00:43:53.153
(They spot their first quokka.)

1057
00:43:53.153 --> 00:43:54.153
Quokka.

1058
00:43:55.383 --> 00:43:56.923
(You startled me.)

1059
00:43:58.284 --> 00:43:59.293
Take a photo with me.

1060
00:44:00.724 --> 00:44:01.994
Quokka, come here.

1061
00:44:01.994 --> 00:44:03.364
(They approach it carefully.)

1062
00:44:05.124 --> 00:44:06.133
Take a photo with me.

1063
00:44:06.193 --> 00:44:07.534
(Look at the camera.)

1064
00:44:07.594 --> 00:44:08.733
- I'm communicating. - Hey.

1065
00:44:10.103 --> 00:44:11.103
My apologies.

1066
00:44:12.804 --> 00:44:14.034
(Their desperate attempts to take photos begin.)

1067
00:44:14.034 --> 00:44:15.034
I want to take a photo next.

1068
00:44:15.034 --> 00:44:16.374
(Their desperate attempts to take photos begin.)

1069
00:44:17.074 --> 00:44:18.103
(Let me pass through.)

1070
00:44:18.103 --> 00:44:19.414
Quokka, come here.

1071
00:44:19.974 --> 00:44:22.483
(I have the right of publicity.)

1072
00:44:23.414 --> 00:44:24.844
(I hate the backlight.)

1073
00:44:24.844 --> 00:44:26.114
Hold on. Please look at the camera again.

1074
00:44:27.753 --> 00:44:28.753
Come here, quokka.

1075
00:44:29.554 --> 00:44:32.594
(They fail to take a photo as Jin Woo is not in the photo.)

1076
00:44:32.594 --> 00:44:35.594
(They fail again because the quokka isn't in the photo.)

1077
00:44:35.594 --> 00:44:38.394
(They fail again because no one is in the photo.)

1078
00:44:39.034 --> 00:44:40.034
This is hard.

1079
00:44:40.034 --> 00:44:41.364
(Taking a selfie with quokkas is hard.)

1080
00:44:41.364 --> 00:44:42.364
It's really hard.

1081
00:44:43.364 --> 00:44:44.664
I think it hates me.

1082
00:44:45.704 --> 00:44:48.074
Why don't you lie down? It could be me that it hates.

1083
00:44:48.074 --> 00:44:49.074
No, no.

1084
00:44:49.543 --> 00:44:52.773
(Why would I hate you?)

1085
00:44:54.713 --> 00:44:56.614
It's eating the leaf like it's the tastiest.

1086
00:45:00.983 --> 00:45:01.983
Quokka.

1087
00:45:01.983 --> 00:45:03.583
(He gives the quokka a leaf.)

1088
00:45:03.853 --> 00:45:04.853
It's eating it.

1089
00:45:05.624 --> 00:45:08.023
- They like leaves. - I see.

1090
00:45:08.023 --> 00:45:09.864
(This is my favorite food.)

1091
00:45:11.164 --> 00:45:12.864
Wait, no. Stay like that. Give me a second.

1092
00:45:13.094 --> 00:45:16.164
Come here. I'll give you the leaf. Jin Woo, I'll bring it here.

1093
00:45:18.633 --> 00:45:19.633
Here.

1094
00:45:19.934 --> 00:45:22.173
How many leaves does it eat?

1095
00:45:22.173 --> 00:45:24.304
(At last...)

1096
00:45:25.844 --> 00:45:27.374
No! It jumps like a kangaroo.

1097
00:45:27.374 --> 00:45:29.213
That was a kangaroo jump!

1098
00:45:30.114 --> 00:45:31.184
- It jumped like a kangaroo. - That was amazing.

1099
00:45:31.583 --> 00:45:33.713
(I'm not a kangaroo.)

1100
00:45:34.813 --> 00:45:37.454
My goodness, it's so adorable.

1101
00:45:38.523 --> 00:45:42.224
(Meanwhile, Min Ho and Seung Yoon haven't found a quokka yet.)

1102
00:45:42.224 --> 00:45:43.224
Hi.

1103
00:45:43.864 --> 00:45:46.094
(There are a lot of people, but...)

1104
00:45:47.463 --> 00:45:48.764
I don't think this is the right way.

1105
00:45:50.063 --> 00:45:51.204
This is nice.

1106
00:45:52.574 --> 00:45:54.903
- I see a lighthouse. - Let's go there.

1107
00:45:55.503 --> 00:45:56.644
(Speeding up)

1108
00:45:57.374 --> 00:45:59.474
(The road is bumpy.)

1109
00:45:59.914 --> 00:46:02.713
(It seems they might have taken the wrong route.)

1110
00:46:04.244 --> 00:46:05.813
I think we might have...

1111
00:46:05.813 --> 00:46:08.014
picked the harder way to come with a bicycle.

1112
00:46:09.184 --> 00:46:11.284
- Let's still go for it. - Let's go.

1113
00:46:12.624 --> 00:46:14.423
(Their bad hunch is proven correct.)

1114
00:46:14.423 --> 00:46:15.923
We're asking for trouble.

1115
00:46:15.923 --> 00:46:17.224
(Their trouble begins.)

1116
00:46:17.994 --> 00:46:20.833
My gosh, we took the wrong route. That was the wrong route.

1117
00:46:21.264 --> 00:46:22.364
What a mistake.

1118
00:46:24.463 --> 00:46:26.804
(They're doing this hard work for no reason.)

1119
00:46:27.733 --> 00:46:29.773
(Panting)

1120
00:46:30.273 --> 00:46:33.543
My gosh, I'm glad we came here.

1121
00:46:36.244 --> 00:46:37.414
It was the right thing to do.

1122
00:46:38.383 --> 00:46:39.554
It's really nice here.

1123
00:46:40.213 --> 00:46:42.114
Look at all the locks hanging.

1124
00:46:42.923 --> 00:46:45.624
Yes, you are the blue sea

1125
00:46:47.153 --> 00:46:50.494
(They take photos of this breathtaking scenery.)

1126
00:46:57.633 --> 00:46:59.874
(He pauses for a moment taking in this serene view.)

1127
00:47:10.014 --> 00:47:12.313
(A selfie in front of a lighthouse they accidentally stopped by)

1128
00:47:13.054 --> 00:47:15.583
(They turn into cheerful youngsters within 5 seconds.)

1129
00:47:22.023 --> 00:47:23.463
This is so fast.

1130
00:47:24.023 --> 00:47:25.693
(They're on their way to look for Quokka again.)

1131
00:47:25.693 --> 00:47:26.693
This is so fast.

1132
00:47:28.193 --> 00:47:29.704
(Meanwhile)

1133
00:47:30.764 --> 00:47:33.833
(There are two guys lying on the ground.)

1134
00:47:35.133 --> 00:47:38.574
(He managed to lure quokka with a leaf.)

1135
00:47:40.374 --> 00:47:45.114
(He managed to take a selfie with quokka.)

1136
00:47:48.383 --> 00:47:49.454
Do you like the leaf?

1137
00:47:50.684 --> 00:47:51.923
- It was so hard. - Do you like the leaf?

1138
00:47:52.224 --> 00:47:53.724
They love these leaves.

1139
00:47:53.954 --> 00:47:55.124
The leaves are the best.

1140
00:47:55.324 --> 00:47:56.394
We should try some leaves too.

1141
00:47:57.224 --> 00:47:58.224
They're juicy.

1142
00:47:59.764 --> 00:48:00.864
I think it's because they're raw leaves.

1143
00:48:01.534 --> 00:48:02.563
This one is dried.

1144
00:48:04.364 --> 00:48:05.773
- I'm eating it. - You should have said so.

1145
00:48:06.403 --> 00:48:07.874
- It's delicious. - You should compare it.

1146
00:48:08.173 --> 00:48:09.374
Have this one too.

1147
00:48:09.374 --> 00:48:10.744
(Compare it with the leaf.)

1148
00:48:12.744 --> 00:48:13.773
I took too long to take a photo.

1149
00:48:14.344 --> 00:48:16.483
(Min Ho and Seung Yoon managed to find the quokka too.)

1150
00:48:17.614 --> 00:48:18.614
It's so cute.

1151
00:48:18.614 --> 00:48:20.184
(Are you Min Ho?)

1152
00:48:20.914 --> 00:48:22.184
(I like your clothes.)

1153
00:48:22.184 --> 00:48:23.184
It's so strong.

1154
00:48:24.454 --> 00:48:26.353
Stop it.

1155
00:48:26.894 --> 00:48:28.824
- Stop it. - What if he breaks it?

1156
00:48:30.124 --> 00:48:31.563
(He's worried.)

1157
00:48:31.563 --> 00:48:33.063
(He's relieved.)

1158
00:48:33.994 --> 00:48:35.934
(It's a selfie time.)

1159
00:48:37.133 --> 00:48:38.534
(Click)

1160
00:48:40.173 --> 00:48:41.704
- Good. It's done. - Good.

1161
00:48:41.833 --> 00:48:43.574
- Good. We took a great one. - Good.

1162
00:48:45.273 --> 00:48:47.273
The quokka looks ugly in the photo, but we look good instead.

1163
00:48:48.744 --> 00:48:51.713
(The quokka looks ugly in the photo.)

1164
00:48:52.454 --> 00:48:54.114
(Upset)

1165
00:48:54.983 --> 00:48:59.394
Let's go skydive

1166
00:49:00.394 --> 00:49:01.594
- Let's go, Seung Hoon. - Okay.

1167
00:49:02.023 --> 00:49:04.793
- Skydive - It must be the one.

1168
00:49:05.733 --> 00:49:07.193
- Skydiving? - Yes.

1169
00:49:07.193 --> 00:49:08.793
- Good. - Hi.

1170
00:49:09.063 --> 00:49:10.063
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1171
00:49:10.463 --> 00:49:11.833
It feels great.

1172
00:49:13.574 --> 00:49:15.474
(It's a fresh start.)

1173
00:49:17.043 --> 00:49:19.773
(They arrived already.)

1174
00:49:21.514 --> 00:49:24.244
(This is where we're going to skydive.)

1175
00:49:24.784 --> 00:49:25.784
- Hi. - Hi.

1176
00:49:25.784 --> 00:49:27.414
(They enter confidently.)

1177
00:49:27.414 --> 00:49:28.554
- Hi. - Here we go.

1178
00:49:29.023 --> 00:49:30.353
- Hi, I'm Gaby. - Hi.

1179
00:49:30.423 --> 00:49:33.193
- Gaby. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

1180
00:49:33.253 --> 00:49:34.253
- Lee. - Lee?

1181
00:49:34.554 --> 00:49:35.764
- Min Ho. - Nice to meet you.

1182
00:49:35.764 --> 00:49:37.063
- I'm Yoon. - All right.

1183
00:49:37.063 --> 00:49:39.164
(He lost his chance to introduce his name.)

1184
00:49:39.293 --> 00:49:41.934
(He feels awkward.)

1185
00:49:42.764 --> 00:49:43.764
It must be the plane.

1186
00:49:44.603 --> 00:49:45.704
- Are we going on that plane? - Yes.

1187
00:49:46.333 --> 00:49:47.574
- Yes. - It's so small.

1188
00:49:47.574 --> 00:49:49.804
- The plane is scarier than jumping. - Really?

1189
00:49:49.804 --> 00:49:50.903
It's scary to get on the plane.

1190
00:49:51.603 --> 00:49:53.443
(Later on)

1191
00:49:54.273 --> 00:49:58.813
(The plane is even worse. Your face is even scarier.)

1192
00:49:59.954 --> 00:50:02.184
(They are excited.)

1193
00:50:03.153 --> 00:50:06.054
- We will be writing a pledge. - Yes.

1194
00:50:06.124 --> 00:50:07.293
Is it a body abandonment memorandum?

1195
00:50:07.624 --> 00:50:09.994
- No. It's for the insurance. - Is it?

1196
00:50:09.994 --> 00:50:11.793
(No, you won't be signing up for the body abandonment memorandum.)

1197
00:50:11.994 --> 00:50:15.063
Can you guys start filling up the forms for me?

1198
00:50:15.833 --> 00:50:18.534
(They need to write their personal information.)

1199
00:50:18.534 --> 00:50:19.833
- Okay. - Thank you.

1200
00:50:20.333 --> 00:50:21.974
- What is this? - I don't understand the first one.

1201
00:50:22.903 --> 00:50:25.304
Is this 15km high? What does "height" mean?

1202
00:50:25.713 --> 00:50:26.713
No.

1203
00:50:26.773 --> 00:50:28.344
It's asking how tall you are.

1204
00:50:29.514 --> 00:50:30.614
- What? - Write how tall you are.

1205
00:50:32.114 --> 00:50:34.753
(He almost wrote 15km for his height.)

1206
00:50:36.124 --> 00:50:38.153
Do we write out Korean address?

1207
00:50:38.153 --> 00:50:39.224
(Please write with human standard.)

1208
00:50:40.253 --> 00:50:43.164
(He's staring at something.)

1209
00:50:44.463 --> 00:50:45.563
(This is what will happen to you.)

1210
00:50:45.563 --> 00:50:46.664
Look at his face.

1211
00:50:48.364 --> 00:50:49.704
We will look like him too.

1212
00:50:50.103 --> 00:50:51.833
- We will be out of breath. - Really?

1213
00:50:53.003 --> 00:50:55.974
You guys will jump from the highest height.

1214
00:50:57.974 --> 00:51:02.043
(He's making this sound to show how excited he is.)

1215
00:51:03.784 --> 00:51:04.784
It's going to be fun.

1216
00:51:08.784 --> 00:51:10.184
(Laughing)

1217
00:51:11.423 --> 00:51:12.423
It's going to be scary too.

1218
00:51:13.594 --> 00:51:15.693
(Why did you want to try skydiving?)

1219
00:51:15.693 --> 00:51:17.693
I just felt like jumping off from somewhere high.

1220
00:51:19.364 --> 00:51:21.733
You get a rope when you're bungee jumping.

1221
00:51:22.034 --> 00:51:24.534
But you have nothing when you're skydiving.

1222
00:51:24.704 --> 00:51:27.204
Skydiving lets you jump freely in the sky.

1223
00:51:28.103 --> 00:51:29.874
I wanted to experience that.

1224
00:51:31.543 --> 00:51:34.644
It was one of the things I've always wanted to try.

1225
00:51:35.273 --> 00:51:36.744
It's going to be fun.

1226
00:51:36.744 --> 00:51:38.644
(He wanted to jump from the sky.)

1227
00:51:39.483 --> 00:51:41.253
What if the parachute doesn't work?

1228
00:51:41.554 --> 00:51:43.184
Gosh. It won't happen.

1229
00:51:44.083 --> 00:51:45.653
What if the parachute doesn't work?

1230
00:51:46.954 --> 00:51:49.063
You have to jump in the ocean if that happens.

1231
00:51:50.523 --> 00:51:52.124
Do we survive if we jump in the ocean?

1232
00:51:52.124 --> 00:51:53.133
We die.

1233
00:51:54.434 --> 00:51:56.764
(It's a simple answer.)

1234
00:51:56.764 --> 00:51:57.864
"We die."

1235
00:51:58.304 --> 00:52:00.603
What if the pilot makes a mistake and fall in the ocean?

1236
00:52:01.474 --> 00:52:03.003
Why do you keep saying that?

1237
00:52:05.503 --> 00:52:11.313
(Make sure to arrive at the drop zone.)

1238
00:52:12.813 --> 00:52:14.753
(Seung Hoon and Jin Woo are going first.)

1239
00:52:14.753 --> 00:52:16.923
- It's better to jump first. - Yes.

1240
00:52:17.184 --> 00:52:19.153
I'm ready. I'm lee.

1241
00:52:22.153 --> 00:52:23.193
Jump buddy.

1242
00:52:24.463 --> 00:52:26.233
(He gets ready to jump with his jump buddy.)

1243
00:52:26.793 --> 00:52:29.233
(He puts on a yellow belt.)

1244
00:52:30.934 --> 00:52:33.474
- You look nervous already. - Yes, I'm nervous.

1245
00:52:33.974 --> 00:52:36.543
(They begin putting the gears on.)

1246
00:52:38.173 --> 00:52:39.173
I'm scared all of a sudden.

1247
00:52:39.943 --> 00:52:41.514
- Are you scared? - Yes.

1248
00:52:41.574 --> 00:52:42.943
- Are you? - Yes.

1249
00:52:43.813 --> 00:52:45.114
- Are you Lee? - Yes.

1250
00:52:45.184 --> 00:52:46.614
- How are you? - Nice to meet you.

1251
00:52:46.914 --> 00:52:49.054
- Lucky for you. - Yes. I'm lucky.

1252
00:52:49.054 --> 00:52:50.184
(You're lucky to see me.)

1253
00:52:50.423 --> 00:52:51.883
He looks nervous, right?

1254
00:52:52.394 --> 00:52:54.594
- He's very nervous. - He's really nervous.

1255
00:52:54.724 --> 00:52:56.193
- He's standing like this. - I know.

1256
00:52:57.463 --> 00:52:58.523
Don't worry.

1257
00:52:58.523 --> 00:53:00.934
(He's standing quietly.)

1258
00:53:01.364 --> 00:53:02.364
He froze.

1259
00:53:02.804 --> 00:53:03.804
He's dying.

1260
00:53:04.164 --> 00:53:06.133
(Is he dying?)

1261
00:53:06.874 --> 00:53:10.074
(He can't hear a thing.)

1262
00:53:10.273 --> 00:53:12.204
You have to take care of your parachute.

1263
00:53:12.344 --> 00:53:13.614
- Is this the parachute? - Yes.

1264
00:53:13.614 --> 00:53:14.974
(You have to get another one if you lose this.)

1265
00:53:15.744 --> 00:53:19.153
(This is a life jacket in case of landing in the ocean.)

1266
00:53:20.054 --> 00:53:22.923
(Everyone received safety training.)

1267
00:53:23.253 --> 00:53:24.824
- Okay. - Make him loosen up a little.

1268
00:53:25.184 --> 00:53:26.724
In 1, 2, 3.

1269
00:53:27.253 --> 00:53:30.264
Give me another one. In 1, 2, 3.

1270
00:53:30.864 --> 00:53:32.124
(He will look like this when jumping off.)

1271
00:53:32.124 --> 00:53:34.364
- That's good. - He's ready to jump.

1272
00:53:34.364 --> 00:53:36.034
In 1, 2, 3.

1273
00:53:36.603 --> 00:53:37.603
Okay.

1274
00:53:37.633 --> 00:53:39.534
(When he's really jumping off,)

1275
00:53:40.874 --> 00:53:44.644
(he will look like this.)

1276
00:53:44.974 --> 00:53:48.244
(He's stamping his feet.)

1277
00:53:48.414 --> 00:53:49.414
I can't wait.

1278
00:53:51.543 --> 00:53:52.784
You will enjoy it so much.

1279
00:53:54.213 --> 00:53:55.554
I want to do it now.

1280
00:53:55.923 --> 00:53:57.383
It makes you even more nervous before you jump.

1281
00:53:58.523 --> 00:53:59.793
(He comes to make fun of Jin Woo.)

1282
00:53:59.793 --> 00:54:01.394
- Are you nervous? - Yes.

1283
00:54:04.164 --> 00:54:05.633
Your lips are dry now.

1284
00:54:06.994 --> 00:54:09.403
(His lips are dry as he's nervous.)

1285
00:54:10.063 --> 00:54:12.733
(But he looks so confident with his gear on.)

1286
00:54:13.534 --> 00:54:14.773
Don't we get goggles?

1287
00:54:15.474 --> 00:54:16.474
Why is this like this?

1288
00:54:16.474 --> 00:54:17.644
(They're talking about something else.)

1289
00:54:18.204 --> 00:54:19.443
- I don't know. - Artificial Intelligence.

1290
00:54:19.914 --> 00:54:21.713
You can apply for one.

1291
00:54:21.713 --> 00:54:24.344
(He has goggles around his neck and he's asking for goggles.)

1292
00:54:24.713 --> 00:54:26.184
Why are you nervous?

1293
00:54:32.894 --> 00:54:35.394
(It's nice to see his jump buddy.)

1294
00:54:36.494 --> 00:54:38.764
(He checks Jin Woo's heart rate.)

1295
00:54:38.864 --> 00:54:39.894
- Good? - Yes.

1296
00:54:39.894 --> 00:54:42.304
(Your heart rate looks good.)

1297
00:54:42.633 --> 00:54:43.633
No problem.

1298
00:54:43.664 --> 00:54:45.034
- I'm nervous. - I'm good.

1299
00:54:45.233 --> 00:54:46.304
I'm nervous. Are you nervous?

1300
00:54:47.474 --> 00:54:48.474
I'm okay.

1301
00:54:49.543 --> 00:54:50.773
- Are you okay? - Yes.

1302
00:54:50.773 --> 00:54:53.543
(Hold this if you're okay.)

1303
00:54:55.144 --> 00:54:58.313
(They are sociable.)

1304
00:55:00.114 --> 00:55:01.253
(Engine sound)

1305
00:55:01.253 --> 00:55:03.253
- It's here. - It's here.

1306
00:55:03.583 --> 00:55:04.954
(Here is your plane.)

1307
00:55:04.954 --> 00:55:05.954
It's here.

1308
00:55:06.594 --> 00:55:08.793
My heart rate looks normal.

1309
00:55:08.793 --> 00:55:10.324
(Beatboxing)

1310
00:55:10.324 --> 00:55:11.563
What are you saying?

1311
00:55:11.624 --> 00:55:14.063
- Your heart is beating so fast. - No. My heart rate looks normal.

1312
00:55:14.063 --> 00:55:16.103
(This is how Jin Woo's heart.)

1313
00:55:16.434 --> 00:55:19.374
(He's beatboxing even faster.)

1314
00:55:20.304 --> 00:55:22.344
(That's the sound of their hearts.)

1315
00:55:23.844 --> 00:55:26.244
(His jump buddy records to celebrate.)

1316
00:55:26.443 --> 00:55:27.943
Let's go. Let's go.

1317
00:55:27.943 --> 00:55:30.313
(He tries to calm himself down by overreacting.)

1318
00:55:30.543 --> 00:55:31.744
- Let's go. - Let's move.

1319
00:55:31.744 --> 00:55:34.514
(They look like escaped prisoners that try to steal the plane.)

1320
00:55:34.514 --> 00:55:35.983
- Let's go. - They're enjoying it.

1321
00:55:35.983 --> 00:55:39.054
(Running)

1322
00:55:39.193 --> 00:55:42.724
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1323
00:55:42.724 --> 00:55:44.324
(They're not talking about the toy.)

1324
00:55:44.624 --> 00:55:45.764
You should jump before me.

1325
00:55:45.994 --> 00:55:47.233
- Let go. - You should jump before me.

1326
00:55:47.233 --> 00:55:48.293
I will jump after you.

1327
00:55:49.333 --> 00:55:50.633
I will get in the pilot's seat.

1328
00:55:50.633 --> 00:55:52.773
(They know how to yield.)

1329
00:55:52.773 --> 00:55:53.874
Check this out.

1330
00:55:54.733 --> 00:55:56.144
(When they're free,)

1331
00:55:57.043 --> 00:56:00.773
(they record the video.)

1332
00:56:01.114 --> 00:56:03.313
(We concentrate on our customer's satisfaction.)

1333
00:56:04.614 --> 00:56:07.753
(They smile like mom and dad.)

1334
00:56:08.883 --> 00:56:10.684
They look nervous from the back.

1335
00:56:11.853 --> 00:56:12.853
They froze.

1336
00:56:14.994 --> 00:56:17.793
(They look like children who need be taken care of.)

1337
00:56:18.094 --> 00:56:19.534
I'm not so nervous yet.

1338
00:56:20.733 --> 00:56:21.934
- I'm not lying. - I'm nervous.

1339
00:56:22.963 --> 00:56:23.963
I'm nervous.

1340
00:56:25.563 --> 00:56:26.874
Seung Hoon is trying to...

1341
00:56:27.273 --> 00:56:29.503
- Act cool. - He pretends like he's not nervous.

1342
00:56:29.574 --> 00:56:31.374
That's why he keeps doing something.

1343
00:56:32.273 --> 00:56:33.273
All right. Let's go.

1344
00:56:33.414 --> 00:56:34.844
(Nervous)

1345
00:56:34.844 --> 00:56:35.844
Go like this.

1346
00:56:37.514 --> 00:56:39.954
He's definitely nervous as he's overreacting.

1347
00:56:40.454 --> 00:56:42.784
(They know about Winner very well.)

1348
00:56:42.784 --> 00:56:44.284
- Jin Woo is nervous too. - Don't act cool.

1349
00:56:45.954 --> 00:56:48.894
(They know it. Stop acting cool.)

1350
00:56:49.894 --> 00:56:52.494
(They finally get on the plane.)

1351
00:56:53.733 --> 00:56:55.804
(Jin Woo gets on the plane first as he's going to jump last.)

1352
00:56:55.864 --> 00:56:56.864
Thumbs up.

1353
00:56:56.864 --> 00:56:59.273
(Seung Hoon who's acting cool gets on the plane too.)

1354
00:56:59.773 --> 00:57:01.133
- We're ready. - We're ready.

1355
00:57:01.745 --> 00:57:03.714
- We're ready. - We're ready.

1356
00:57:05.585 --> 00:57:06.654
Let's go. Let's go.

1357
00:57:07.585 --> 00:57:09.484
(Let's go.)

1358
00:57:10.725 --> 00:57:13.625
(My heart is pounding.)

1359
00:57:13.855 --> 00:57:15.924
I forgot what they told me to do.

1360
00:57:17.395 --> 00:57:19.165
I only remember that we should say "Banana".

1361
00:57:20.165 --> 00:57:21.464
Seung Hoon and Jin Woo!

1362
00:57:22.605 --> 00:57:24.034
(He gives his friends words of blessing.)

1363
00:57:24.034 --> 00:57:25.205
Come back alive!

1364
00:57:26.275 --> 00:57:29.005
(Let's have a talk when we come back, Min Ho.)

1365
00:57:30.804 --> 00:57:33.415
(The light aircraft enters the runway.)

1366
00:57:33.415 --> 00:57:34.415
All right.

1367
00:57:36.844 --> 00:57:37.844
All right.

1368
00:57:39.955 --> 00:57:42.855
- Fly! - Fly!

1369
00:57:42.855 --> 00:57:45.125
Fly! Fly! Fly! Fly!

1370
00:57:48.355 --> 00:57:50.694
It's in the air! When did it get off the ground?

1371
00:57:53.264 --> 00:57:55.764
I am satisfied with this.

1372
00:57:58.065 --> 00:58:01.505
(The scenery outside the window makes them happy.)

1373
00:58:03.074 --> 00:58:05.074
The scenery is nice and pretty.

1374
00:58:05.074 --> 00:58:06.275
Why did I say I will jump off the plane?

1375
00:58:08.315 --> 00:58:09.645
(My goodness.)

1376
00:58:10.745 --> 00:58:13.554
(They continue to take pictures for memories.)

1377
00:58:14.315 --> 00:58:16.654
(I like it.)

1378
00:58:18.455 --> 00:58:20.755
(After the takeoff, the plane arrives at a spot...)

1379
00:58:22.094 --> 00:58:25.764
(with a bird's-eye view of the island.)

1380
00:58:27.694 --> 00:58:29.904
(Reaching 15,000ft in the air,)

1381
00:58:29.904 --> 00:58:32.835
(the plane grows smaller.)

1382
00:58:33.775 --> 00:58:35.875
(Min Ho was watching without a word.)

1383
00:58:36.645 --> 00:58:38.245
(My goodness.)

1384
00:58:38.844 --> 00:58:40.174
Jin Woo got his wish.

1385
00:58:41.444 --> 00:58:43.145
Jin Woo got his wish.

1386
00:58:44.514 --> 00:58:46.114
- We will finally jump off a plane. - What?

1387
00:58:46.114 --> 00:58:47.784
- We will finally jump off a plane. - I know.

1388
00:58:48.815 --> 00:58:50.924
- We will finally jump off a plane. - Yes, finally.

1389
00:58:51.625 --> 00:58:52.625
Come on, guys.

1390
00:58:52.625 --> 00:58:54.125
(The other two beagles get going too.)

1391
00:58:54.125 --> 00:58:57.065
- Let's go. Move, move, move. - Move, move, move.

1392
00:58:57.125 --> 00:58:58.165
- Let's go, let's go. - Move, move.

1393
00:58:58.495 --> 00:58:59.795
Move, move, move, move, move.

1394
00:59:00.234 --> 00:59:01.295
Move, move, move, move.

1395
00:59:03.904 --> 00:59:04.904
I am tired.

1396
00:59:04.904 --> 00:59:06.074
(They have poor stamina.)

1397
00:59:06.074 --> 00:59:07.074
I am tired.

1398
00:59:08.134 --> 00:59:11.975
(However, they recover quickly...)

1399
00:59:13.514 --> 00:59:16.344
(and make strange noises often.)

1400
00:59:16.844 --> 00:59:20.815
Winner, Winner! We are going up!

1401
00:59:21.154 --> 00:59:24.054
(Don't touch them when they are excited.)

1402
00:59:25.725 --> 00:59:28.495
(After 15 minutes of flight)

1403
00:59:29.165 --> 00:59:30.594
- Hey, Seung Yoon! - Yes?

1404
00:59:30.594 --> 00:59:31.764
We are almost there.

1405
00:59:34.895 --> 00:59:36.304
We are almost there!

1406
00:59:38.634 --> 00:59:40.105
It's a bit nerve-wracking to do this again.

1407
00:59:41.705 --> 00:59:44.645
(How do they feel before their first skydive?)

1408
00:59:46.514 --> 00:59:48.045
(Two thumbs up)

1409
00:59:48.045 --> 00:59:49.384
(Another thumb up)

1410
00:59:49.514 --> 00:59:50.514
(Double thumbs up)

1411
00:59:50.514 --> 00:59:51.514
Let's go!

1412
00:59:52.355 --> 00:59:55.014
(They feel good enough to give thumbs up.)

1413
00:59:55.154 --> 00:59:57.484
Go, go, go, go, go!

1414
00:59:58.355 --> 00:59:59.355
Let's go!

1415
00:59:59.355 --> 01:00:00.395
(I am nervous.)

1416
01:00:02.694 --> 01:00:03.764
I am nervous.

1417
01:00:05.364 --> 01:00:08.694
(His heart pounds...)

1418
01:00:08.694 --> 01:00:11.565
(and his lips go dry.)

1419
01:00:12.404 --> 01:00:14.574
(He breathes in and out...)

1420
01:00:14.574 --> 01:00:17.404
(and imagines himself in the air.)

1421
01:00:17.875 --> 01:00:19.045
- Okay. - All right.

1422
01:00:19.045 --> 01:00:20.745
(These beagle-like boys are relaxed since they had done it before.)

1423
01:00:20.745 --> 01:00:21.975
Let's go, let's go.

1424
01:00:22.284 --> 01:00:24.685
(I am so excited.)

1425
01:00:26.815 --> 01:00:28.815
Get it, boys.

1426
01:00:31.424 --> 01:00:33.625
- Okay. - Open the door!

1427
01:00:33.625 --> 01:00:35.864
(Screaming)

1428
01:00:40.634 --> 01:00:42.165
(Surprised)

1429
01:00:43.134 --> 01:00:46.205
(The exit is to the right.)

1430
01:00:48.634 --> 01:00:50.745
(Into the sky,)

1431
01:00:51.705 --> 01:00:54.475
(he carefully puts out his feet.)

1432
01:00:58.955 --> 01:01:01.484
(He will jump into the new world.)

1433
01:01:20.835 --> 01:01:22.775
(The beagle-like boys are ready to jump too.)

1434
01:01:23.344 --> 01:01:24.775
(Welcome.)

1435
01:01:30.484 --> 01:01:32.415
(I am so happy.)

1436
01:01:38.484 --> 01:01:41.625
(He puts his feet in the air...)

1437
01:01:42.565 --> 01:01:44.964
(and takes a step forward.)

1438
01:01:46.234 --> 01:01:48.495
Okay. Okay.

1439
01:01:50.134 --> 01:01:51.134
Okay.

1440
01:01:51.705 --> 01:01:53.234
- Ready? - Okay.

1441
01:02:04.484 --> 01:02:08.185
(There is no distinction between the sky and the sea.)

1442
01:02:08.815 --> 01:02:11.054
(Into the wind between them,)

1443
01:02:11.054 --> 01:02:13.225
(they throw their bodies.)

1444
01:02:14.125 --> 01:02:16.625
(He transforms into Superman.)

1445
01:02:17.165 --> 01:02:19.534
(He attacks with his hair.)

1446
01:02:20.634 --> 01:02:22.605
(It's fusion time!)

1447
01:02:23.134 --> 01:02:24.134
Let's go!

1448
01:02:24.134 --> 01:02:25.975
(After people jump off the plane,)

1449
01:02:28.105 --> 01:02:31.344
(the pilot closes the door and leaves in a cool-headed way.)

1450
01:02:32.714 --> 01:02:35.145
(Lastly,)

1451
01:02:36.514 --> 01:02:38.444
(it's Jin Woo's turn to jump.)

1452
01:02:39.255 --> 01:02:41.984
(Is this okay?)

1453
01:02:44.424 --> 01:02:45.424
Right before I jumped,

1454
01:02:46.495 --> 01:02:50.824
the strap became a bit loose.

1455
01:02:51.424 --> 01:02:56.205
I kept asking the instructor if it's okay,

1456
01:02:56.205 --> 01:02:57.705
but he jumped off without a word.

1457
01:02:59.304 --> 01:03:00.775
He jumped off right away.

1458
01:03:01.605 --> 01:03:04.245
(The gear was thoroughly checked for safety ahead of time.)

1459
01:03:06.344 --> 01:03:08.444
(I will be back.)

1460
01:03:09.545 --> 01:03:12.014
(Screaming)

1461
01:03:12.614 --> 01:03:14.955
(It's closing time.)

1462
01:03:16.085 --> 01:03:19.025
(How did it feel to finally jump off the plane?)

1463
01:03:19.025 --> 01:03:20.025
It just...

1464
01:03:21.054 --> 01:03:22.594
I don't know. It just felt great.

1465
01:03:28.795 --> 01:03:32.335
(It's a moment that dazzles without any impressive words.)

1466
01:03:33.574 --> 01:03:37.344
(It's a moment that just feels great.)

1467
01:03:40.674 --> 01:03:41.674
Yes!

1468
01:03:41.674 --> 01:03:44.915
(After 1-minute free fall,)

1469
01:03:45.654 --> 01:03:49.554
(the parachute unfolds so that they can ride the wind.)

1470
01:03:49.984 --> 01:03:52.755
(Laughing)

1471
01:03:53.725 --> 01:03:56.424
(He savors every moment.)

1472
01:03:56.424 --> 01:03:57.665
Nice!

1473
01:04:07.034 --> 01:04:09.205
(Screaming)

1474
01:04:09.705 --> 01:04:11.605
(Shouting)

1475
01:04:13.975 --> 01:04:15.214
That was nice.

1476
01:04:15.275 --> 01:04:16.484
- That was very nice. - Very good.

1477
01:04:18.384 --> 01:04:19.384
You should do it.

1478
01:04:20.514 --> 01:04:23.255
You should do it no matter what.

1479
01:04:23.855 --> 01:04:25.324
- The skydiving? - Yes.

1480
01:04:26.054 --> 01:04:27.194
It's a must.

1481
01:04:27.424 --> 01:04:30.694
Because the Korean society is highly competitive,

1482
01:04:32.364 --> 01:04:37.605
a lot of people are struggling.

1483
01:04:37.935 --> 01:04:39.734
Through exciting events...

1484
01:04:39.734 --> 01:04:44.605
or activities such as skydiving,

1485
01:04:45.005 --> 01:04:50.085
you can let go of your pent-up emotions.

1486
01:04:51.214 --> 01:04:53.514
What kind of emotions did you scatter in the sky?

1487
01:04:57.455 --> 01:04:58.585
The situation is similar for me too.

1488
01:04:59.355 --> 01:05:01.924
I released...

1489
01:05:03.324 --> 01:05:06.335
the pent-up stress.

1490
01:05:07.134 --> 01:05:08.435
It was a meaningful experience.

1491
01:05:09.804 --> 01:05:13.074
(Even a young man in his 20s has worries he can't share.)

1492
01:05:13.074 --> 01:05:14.134
You can't share it.

1493
01:05:15.205 --> 01:05:16.205
No.

1494
01:05:18.375 --> 01:05:19.375
Okay, I see.

1495
01:05:20.444 --> 01:05:23.614
(The pent-up emotions in his heart...)

1496
01:05:24.984 --> 01:05:28.214
(scatter in the sky.)

1497
01:05:28.355 --> 01:05:29.654
Oh, yes.

1498
01:05:31.955 --> 01:05:32.955
Cool!

1499
01:05:32.955 --> 01:05:36.864
(He feels like he is walking on air.)

1500
01:05:37.864 --> 01:05:39.134
Look at that view!

1501
01:05:40.665 --> 01:05:42.534
(He keeps giving thumbs up.)

1502
01:05:47.404 --> 01:05:49.375
How was the dive? Okay?

1503
01:05:50.275 --> 01:05:51.745
Give me high five, man.

1504
01:05:54.145 --> 01:05:56.014
- Here we go! - Here we go!

1505
01:06:05.185 --> 01:06:06.554
Mama, Papa,

1506
01:06:06.554 --> 01:06:10.594
Haute, my sister, I love you!

1507
01:06:12.024 --> 01:06:14.194
Youth Over Flowers is the best!

1508
01:06:15.434 --> 01:06:19.835
(A beautiful moment passes like the wind.)

1509
01:06:24.675 --> 01:06:29.585
(The Earth pulls his feet.)

1510
01:06:31.944 --> 01:06:34.854
(He's making heart.)

1511
01:06:34.854 --> 01:06:38.425
I love you! I love you!

1512
01:06:39.194 --> 01:06:41.394
(Seung Hoon came back from the sky as a loving man.)

1513
01:06:41.394 --> 01:06:42.965
Let's go. Let's go.

1514
01:06:47.635 --> 01:06:49.305
Thank you.

1515
01:06:49.665 --> 01:06:51.835
Thank you. I love you. I love you.

1516
01:06:59.314 --> 01:07:03.015
(Jin Woo really wanted to try skydiving.)

1517
01:07:03.845 --> 01:07:05.755
(Shouting)

1518
01:07:06.484 --> 01:07:08.314
(Shouting)

1519
01:07:09.524 --> 01:07:12.524
(He learned different exclamations.)

1520
01:07:16.995 --> 01:07:18.364
It's Jin Woo!

1521
01:07:21.734 --> 01:07:22.734
Nice!

1522
01:07:25.734 --> 01:07:27.875
(Two thumbs up)

1523
01:07:34.175 --> 01:07:35.175
All right.

1524
01:07:37.915 --> 01:07:38.915
(My goodness.)

1525
01:07:38.915 --> 01:07:40.184
Thank you.

1526
01:07:42.284 --> 01:07:43.724
(Everyone looks happy.)

1527
01:07:43.724 --> 01:07:45.625
Thank you. It's great.

1528
01:07:47.625 --> 01:07:48.795
I am glad you made it.

1529
01:07:49.095 --> 01:07:50.095
I did it!

1530
01:07:53.434 --> 01:07:55.394
I loved it. It was the best!

1531
01:07:58.904 --> 01:07:59.904
My goodness.

1532
01:07:59.904 --> 01:08:02.404
(His legs give out,)

1533
01:08:04.045 --> 01:08:05.045
(but he has friends who raise him up...)

1534
01:08:05.045 --> 01:08:06.074
Get up.

1535
01:08:09.114 --> 01:08:10.684
(and welcome him.)

1536
01:08:10.684 --> 01:08:11.684
Let's get it.

1537
01:08:16.125 --> 01:08:18.585
That's the highest point you can skydive from, right?

1538
01:08:19.795 --> 01:08:21.894
(Jin Woo now dreams of reaching a higher point.)

1539
01:08:21.894 --> 01:08:23.995
I want to do it again if I can.

1540
01:08:26.765 --> 01:08:29.335
I can't believe I came this far and skydived.

1541
01:08:29.335 --> 01:08:31.064
I am walking like this.

1542
01:08:32.705 --> 01:08:35.234
I usually walk straight, but I can't help but walking...

1543
01:08:35.604 --> 01:08:37.444
- with my toes pointed out now. - Me too.

1544
01:08:38.644 --> 01:08:39.814
Still, it's nice.

1545
01:08:40.614 --> 01:08:43.845
A bird's-eye view of the island was beautiful.

1546
01:08:44.515 --> 01:08:45.814
I know. It was really nice.

1547
01:08:46.385 --> 01:08:47.385
Quokka.

1548
01:08:48.354 --> 01:08:49.354
See you next time.

1549
01:08:51.684 --> 01:08:52.694
Next time.

1550
01:08:54.295 --> 01:08:59.995
(We apologize. Due to the length of the episode,)

1551
01:09:01.564 --> 01:09:06.104
(this story will be revealed next week.)

1552
01:09:06.574 --> 01:09:08.904
(Anyway...)

1553
01:09:09.245 --> 01:09:10.574
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

1554
01:09:10.745 --> 01:09:11.974
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

1555
01:09:11.974 --> 01:09:14.245
(They rent a van.)

1556
01:09:17.484 --> 01:09:19.715
(They say goodbye to the prison uniform.)

1557
01:09:19.715 --> 01:09:21.255
(Heave-ho)

1558
01:09:22.224 --> 01:09:25.125
(The youth are here to ride the waves.)

1559
01:09:25.484 --> 01:09:27.724
(They are novices.)

1560
01:09:27.724 --> 01:09:31.024
(They are swimming on the ground.)

1561
01:09:31.495 --> 01:09:32.894
(Waves,)

1562
01:09:32.894 --> 01:09:34.595
(here I come.)

1563
01:09:35.295 --> 01:09:39.175
(Will Winner be able to enjoy surfing?)

1564
01:09:39.904 --> 01:09:42.474
(They are on their way to the hotel in Margaret River.)

1565
01:09:42.944 --> 01:09:50.215
(They travel with sunset and song.)

1566
01:09:50.484 --> 01:09:54.215
(Who cares if there is no WiFi? Their days are full of excitements.)

1567
01:09:54.215 --> 01:09:55.724
Let's hurry up and go.

1568
01:09:56.224 --> 01:09:57.585
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1569
01:09:57.585 --> 01:09:58.585
Let's go.

1570
01:10:02.665 --> 01:10:03.724
Thank you, Seung Hoon.

1571
01:10:05.194 --> 01:10:07.165
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

1572
01:10:10.404 --> 01:10:11.505
This is romantic.

1573
01:10:11.805 --> 01:10:12.835
My goodness.

1574
01:10:20.045 --> 01:10:24.245
(Seung Yoon, did you enjoy Youth Over Flowers?)

1575
01:10:24.245 --> 01:10:29.184
(It's time to go to prison now.)

1576
01:10:29.184 --> 01:10:34.224
("Prison Playbook")

1577
01:10:34.224 --> 01:10:37.295
(He practices over and over again to give the perfect performance.)

1578
01:10:37.295 --> 01:10:39.295
(The singer who debuted 12 years ago, Taeyang)

1579
01:10:39.295 --> 01:10:41.234
(Inside that singer lives another person, Dong Young Bae.)

1580
01:10:41.364 --> 01:10:44.904
(He shows off his beagle-like charms every day.)

1581
01:10:44.904 --> 01:10:47.205
I want to show my honest self without pretenses.

1582
01:10:47.205 --> 01:10:49.045
("Livin' the Double Life")
